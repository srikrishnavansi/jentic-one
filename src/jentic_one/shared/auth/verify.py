    **The** place where this deployment's OAuth2 wire vocabulary crosses into its
    internal authorization vocabulary. A token minted by this deployment's
    authorization server carries its grant as scopes — in the ``scopes`` claim of a
    JWT, or in the ``access_tokens.scopes`` snapshot behind an opaque token;
    everything downstream of verification — route guards,
    :class:`~jentic_one.shared.auth.identity.Identity`, query scoping — reasons in
    permissions only. Callers: :func:`verify_token` below and
    :class:`jentic_one.broker.repos.token_resolver.InProcessTokenResolver`.

    Two other places depend on the same identity without converting through here:
    :data:`jentic_one.shared.auth.permission_catalog.MCP_TOOL_SCOPES` (an OAuth2
    ceiling defined as a permission baseline) and
    :func:`jentic_one.auth.web.routers.authorize._scope_to_permission_description`
    (consent copy looked up in the permission catalogue). Changing the translation
    here means revisiting both.

    The translation is identity today: the two formats use the same colon-form
    strings, so a scope *is* a permission name. Keeping it a named function means
    the day they diverge (a scope prefix, an audience qualifier, a coarser wire
    grant) there is exactly one function to change rather than an inlined
    ``list(...)`` to find.
