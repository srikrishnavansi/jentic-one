"""Shared permission-expansion helper.

Wraps the shared implication map (``compute_effective``) so non-web callers — e.g. a
service that must make an authorization decision *beyond* the route's declared
permission — can ask "does this identity effectively hold permission X?" without
reaching up into the admin tier (the module-boundary arch rules forbid a
registry/broker/control → admin import; the implication data lives in
``shared.auth.permission_catalog``, #938).
This mirrors the expansion the request guard applies in ``shared/web/deps.py``: grants
are expanded through the static implication map (so ``org:admin`` implies everything and
``*:write`` implies ``*:read``) before the membership test.
