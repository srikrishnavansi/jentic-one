"""Agent scope ceiling: which platform scopes a caller may grant to an agent.

Tier-neutral so both sides of the rule share one predicate:

- ``auth`` enforces it on agent create / approve / replace-scopes
  (``jentic_one.auth.services.agent_scope_ceiling``);
- ``admin`` reflects it in the ``grantable_by_caller`` flag of
  ``GET /permissions`` so the UI never offers a scope the server rejects.

The rule, for a scope in the permission catalogue:

- a caller holding ``org:admin`` may grant any scope;
- any other caller may grant a scope in its own effective (implication-expanded)
  permission set or in the default agent baseline
  (:data:`~jentic_one.shared.auth.permission_catalog.DEFAULT_AGENT_PERMISSIONS`), and never
  ``org:admin`` or ``agents:write``, even if it holds them.
