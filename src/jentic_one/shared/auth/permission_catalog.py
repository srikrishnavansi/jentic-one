"""Static permission catalogue and implication map (tier-neutral).

Home of the permission *data* — the permission name constants, the `Permission`
dataclass, the `ALL_PERMISSIONS` catalogue, the derived `IMPLICATION_MAP`, and the
pure `compute_effective` / `compute_implies_transitive` expansion helpers. It lives
in ``shared/auth`` (not ``admin``) so any tier can expand grants through the
implication map without a layering inversion: ``shared`` callers
(``shared/web/deps.py``, ``shared/web/permission_catalog_payload.py``,
``shared/web/endpoint_permissions.py``, ``shared/auth/permissions.py``) and non-web
service callers alike import from here rather than reaching up into the admin tier
(#938). The broker is the reason the constants are tier-neutral: it cannot import
from admin, so the permission strings it shares with admin are defined here.

``admin.core.permissions`` re-exports everything here for backward compatibility,
so existing ``from jentic_one.admin.core.permissions import …`` call sites keep
working unchanged; admin stays the documented home for permission *concepts*, the
data just lives in shared. This module has no admin-tier import, which is what lets
the ``test_shared_does_not_import_admin_permissions`` arch guard pass
unconditionally.

**Vocabulary.** A *permission* is what an actor may do — the thing stored in
``actor_permission_grants``, carried on ``Identity.permissions``, and enforced by
route guards. A *scope* is the same string travelling over this deployment's own
OAuth2/OIDC plane. Constants named ``*_SCOPES`` below are therefore deliberate:
they describe the OAuth2 wire surface, not internal authorization. The two formats
are identical today, and the places that would break if they ever diverged are
:data:`MCP_TOOL_SCOPES` here and
:func:`jentic_one.shared.auth.verify.scopes_to_permissions`.

#:   is gone; nothing is left to delegate reads over).
#: - The service-account permissions retired in theme-8 Phase 2 (the
#:   service-account surface is gone; every SA was migrated to a successor agent
#:   in Phase 1). Stored strings are swept with the Phase-4 table drops.
