"""Endpoint → actor-type → permission join for authorization metadata.

This module derives, for every operation in the control-plane app, the **actor
types** that may call it and the **permission(s)** it requires, and turns that
into a richer, advisory join (typical caller, auth notes, implied-permission
closure) consumed by :mod:`jentic_one.shared.web.endpoint_reference` to build the
CLI / docs reference — see :func:`build_operation_auth_map`.

The OpenAPI document itself only models the real authentication mechanism
(``BearerAuth``); the permission/actor join is *not* expressed as native OpenAPI
``security`` because OpenAPI's model can't faithfully carry it (OR-of-permissions,
the ``org:admin`` superuser bypass, the typical-caller hint, and the fact that
many permissions are enforced in the service layer rather than at the gateway). A
fabricated OAuth2 flow would misrepresent that, so the canonical authz reference
lives in the endpoint reference / ``GET /reference/endpoints.json`` sidecar that
the CLI and docs SPA actually consume.

Why a curated map exists
------------------------
Most permission checks for the control plane happen in the *service layer*, not
at the FastAPI dependency, so the route object alone does not know the required
permission. For those operations we
fall back to :data:`PATH_PERMISSION_OVERRIDES` / :data:`ACTOR_TYPE_OVERRIDES` below.

Contributing (humans **and** agents)
------------------------------------
This map is the human-editable source of truth for the endpoint reference. To
correct or enrich an entry:

1. Edit :data:`PATH_PERMISSION_OVERRIDES` / :data:`ACTOR_TYPE_OVERRIDES` here (or, better,
   add ``required_permissions=[...]`` to the route's ``get_current_identity(...)``
   so it becomes recoverable without curation).
2. Run ``make endpoints`` to regenerate ``docs/reference/endpoints.{md,json}`` and
   ``make openapi`` to regenerate the specs.
3. Commit the code change **and** the regenerated artifacts together.

Never hand-edit the generated files under ``docs/reference/`` — they carry a
``DO NOT EDIT`` header and are guarded by a drift test.

#: reference, not the spec) so the reference does not mislabel them as public.
