"""Canonical endpoint → permission → typical-caller reference, built from code.

This is the single source of truth for the *authorization* reference — which
actor types may call each operation, the permission(s) it requires, the typical
caller, and any non-standard credential note. It is deliberately **separate**
from the OpenAPI document:

- The OpenAPI spec models only the real *authentication* mechanism
  (``BearerAuth`` — an opaque bearer token). It does **not** express per-operation
  permissions/actor types, because OpenAPI's ``security`` model cannot faithfully
  carry our authorization semantics (OR-of-permissions, the ``org:admin`` superuser
  bypass, the typical-caller hint, and permissions enforced in the service layer
  rather than at the gateway). Encoding those as a fabricated OAuth2 flow would
  misrepresent enforcement.
- This module is therefore the authoritative, machine-readable authorization
  reference that the CLI and docs SPA consume.

Consumers:

- ``tools/endpoint_tree.py`` renders this to ``docs/reference/endpoints.{md,json}``.
  It introspects a freshly-built broker app for the broker surface.
- ``GET /reference/endpoints.json`` serves :func:`build_reference_payload` live.
  It is mounted only on the control-plane app (the broker runs as a separate
  process), so it cannot introspect the broker; the broker surface is supplied
  declaratively by :func:`_declared_broker_endpoints` instead.

Both paths therefore call :func:`build_reference_payload` over the same set of
endpoints and serve byte-identical payloads. A drift test
(:mod:`tests.arch.test_endpoint_tree`) pins the declared broker surface to the
real broker app and asserts the live payload equals the committed file.
