# CLI lane — read this when your session has the `jentic` CLI on PATH

This file carries the CLI-session mechanics for every step of the Jentic
loop in `SKILL.md` (identity → discover → check access → execute): the
commands, flags, exit codes, environment variables, and failure diagnosis.
If your session drives Jentic through MCP tools instead, close this file and
read `references/mcp.md`.

## Prerequisites (CLI session)

- The `jentic` CLI is installed and on PATH.
- A reachable Jentic control plane. The base URL comes from the active
  context's environment — set it with `jentic env add <name> --url <URL>`
  and select it with `jentic context use <name>` (inspect via
  `jentic context view`). Onboard a fresh machine with `jentic register
  --url <URL>`. There is no `--base-url` flag on data-plane commands.
- Remote deployments: if the environment's base URL is remote (an
  `https://…` host in `jentic context view`), the broker must be set
  explicitly too — `broker_url` on the environment (pass `--broker-url` to
  `register`, or `jentic env add`), or `JENTIC_BROKER_URL` in file-less
  mode. It is never derived from the control-plane URL. A loopback install
  seeds it automatically.

## Step 1 — identity

```
jentic doctor
```

If the Identity section passes (a registered identity and a usable token or
API key), skip to step 2. If it does not (no context, "not registered", or
"pending"), **stop and ask your operator** to run
`jentic register --url <install URL>` and approve the agent — that step
blocks on a human and cannot be completed by an autonomous agent. (For a
local install the URL must be `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, not `localhost` — the
token audience is matched exactly.) Once approved, a token is minted and
reused automatically; you never handle raw API credentials — the CLI
attaches the bearer token for you.

If your operator self-registered this agent and handed you a one-time claim
token, bind it to a human identity with `jentic identity claim <agent-id>
--token <token>` (an agent cannot claim itself; requires an active human
context).

## Step 2 — access

See your own identity, status, permissions, and credential bindings (with the
APIs each one serves):

```
jentic whoami
```

(`jentic api GET /me` returns the same view; `whoami` is the nicer form.)

Decide access from that view first (see `SKILL.md` step 2 for the
doctrine). When the missing credential is for a vendor in the deployment's
connect registry, **start the connection yourself**:

```
jentic connect github --reason "read open PRs to summarise them"
```

It prints the `approval_url` (and the resolved flow) — relay the URL to
your human operator, who opens it in their browser and approves the
connection and its scopes; you never open or approve it. `--scopes` names
vendor scopes to request (write scopes are flagged for the approver);
`--wait` polls until the session connects or ends (rejected, expired, or cancelled;
exit 3 if the timeout lapses while still pending). Once they confirm,
re-check `jentic whoami` — an agent-initiated connect binds you at
approval — and retry the `execute` that was blocked.

For APIs outside the registry, **report the gap to your operator in
one complete summary** — the API (vendor/name), the auth type the spec
declares, the operations you intend to call, your proposed permission
rules, and why. Approval is always a human action, and so are binding an
existing credential and permission grants: the operator acts in the Jentic One
dashboard. Bindings take effect live — once your operator confirms, just
retry the `execute` that was blocked. Newly granted **permissions** bake into
your token at mint time, so after a permission grant run `jentic logout` (it
clears only the cached token, not your identity) before retrying — the next
call mints a fresh token that carries the permission.

### The reactive path: denial directives

If you'd rather be reactive, the broker also guides you: when `execute` is
denied it prints a recovery line on stderr (the `agent_directive`) and
**exits 2**, so you can branch on the exit code instead of mistaking the 4xx
body for success. The per-code MEANINGS (what each denial signifies, the
`api_served` fork, `parameters.expected` vs `parameters.found`,
which recoveries an operator must perform) are shared by both lanes and
live in `references/recovery.md`; what follows is this lane's mechanics per
code:

- **`no_credential_binding` (403)** — with `api_served: false` no credential
  is provisioned for the API at all: if the directive carries a
  `suggested_command` (`jentic connect <vendor>`), run it and relay the
  printed `approval_url` to your operator; otherwise ask them to connect or
  provision a credential in the dashboard and bind you to it, proposing the
  auth type and permission rules you read from the API spec (see `SKILL.md`
  step 2).
  With `api_served: true` a credential already serves the API and you just
  aren't bound: ask your operator to bind you to it (dashboard, or
  `POST /agents/{agent_id}/credentials`). Then retry.
- **`credential_not_provisioned` (424)** — if the directive carries a
  `suggested_command` (`jentic connect <key>`), the vendor is in the
  connect registry: run it and relay the printed `approval_url` to your
  operator; otherwise relay the directive's `provisioning_url` (when
  present) — or report the gap — so they can connect the account. Then
  retry.
- **`credential_undecryptable` (424)** — ask your operator to remove and
  re-add the credential, then retry; this is not agent-recoverable.
- **`credential_identity_mismatch` (403)** — read the directive's
  `parameters.expected` vs `parameters.found` and ask your operator to fix
  or re-provision the credential so it targets `expected`, then retry.
- **`ambiguous_credential_binding` (409)** — resend the same `execute` with
  `--header Jentic-Credential-Id=<credential_id>` picked from the
  directive's `candidates` (the directive's `parameters.headers` carries the
  exact header; `--header Jentic-Credential-Name=<name>` also works when
  credential names are unique).

Always follow the `agent_directive`'s instruction / `provisioning_url`
rather than assuming which recovery applies. You can also report access
gaps proactively before you're denied. To propose rules from the
spec, read the operation surface first: `jentic apis operations
<vendor/name/version>` and `jentic inspect <target>` show methods,
paths, and the declared auth.

## Step 3 — find an operation (import first, then search)

```
jentic catalog search "spreadsheets"
jentic catalog import googleapis.com/sheets
jentic search "get values from a spreadsheet range" --limit 10
jentic apis operations googleapis-com/googleapis-com-sheets/v4
```

Re-importing an API that is already there is safe — the registry state
converges — but this lane surfaces the duplicate as a **failed
(dead-letter) import** whose error says a revision with identical content
already exists. Treat that error as "already there" — don't retry. (The HTTP
MCP mount reports the same duplicate as an `already_imported` success — a
surface difference, not a state difference.)

If `import` unexpectedly fails with `403 … requires one of: catalog:import`
— e.g. you were approved before `catalog:import` became a default permission and
weren't re-granted — ask your operator to grant the `catalog:import` permission
to this agent in the dashboard. Once they confirm, run `jentic logout` so
the next call mints a fresh token carrying the permission, then retry:

```
jentic catalog import googleapis.com/sheets
```

To register an API that is **not** in the catalog, upload its OpenAPI spec
directly with `jentic apis import <file|url> --vendor <vendor> --name <name>
--version <version>` (reads a local file inline or fetches a URL; async,
prints a job id). This needs `apis:write` rather than `catalog:import`.

`search` returns JSON when piped. Each hit carries a `target` — pass it
verbatim to `inspect`/`execute`. It is the hit's `METHOD:url` pair (e.g.
`GET:https://…`), or its registry `operation_id` when the hit's `url` is
host-relative (e.g. `/pets` — the spec declares no absolute server, so it
can't form a `METHOD:url` target). An `operation_id` target is
inspect-only: `execute` refuses it with `RESOLVE_FAILED`, since there is no
upstream host to proxy to. Don't build targets yourself from `method` + `url`. (The id shown
by `jentic catalog show` is the spec's `operationId`; it also resolves, as
a compatibility fallback.)

If `search` returns no results, it prints a hint to run `jentic catalog
search` / `jentic catalog import` first — that almost always means nothing
relevant is imported yet. Import and search again.

`jentic catalog outdated` lists registered APIs whose upstream spec changed
since import (also surfaced by `jenticctl status`). Re-importing promotes
the new spec to **live**, changing behavior, so this is an **operator**
decision: **suggest** the re-import (`jentic catalog import <vendor/name>`)
to the operator and let them run it — never silently re-import on your own.
(`jentic catalog refresh` rebuilds the catalog manifest from upstream but
requires `org:admin`, so it too is an operator action.)

To read the connected backend's identity facts in this lane:

```
jentic context view        # shows the active context's environment + base_url
jentic api GET /instance   # reads the connected backend's identity (auth attached)
```

The unauthenticated `/instance` response also carries `broker_url` — the
broker / data-plane base URL for `execute`, when the backend can advertise
one (null otherwise).

## Step 4 — inspect

```
jentic inspect "$(jentic search 'get spreadsheet values' --json | jq -r '.data[0].target')"
jentic inspect 'GET https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/{spreadsheetId}/values/{range}'
```

On a 404, `inspect` prints the reason and a hint on stderr and exits 2 (it
is not silent). If a target doesn't resolve, re-run `search` and use a
hit's `target` — don't guess ids. A `METHOD:url` target that matches more
than one operation fails as an ambiguous match (409): pin `--revision`, or
pass the hit's `operation_id`, which always names exactly one operation.

In the JSON output, `api.vendor`/`api.name`/`api.version` is the canonical API
reference — copy those into credential scopes, revision pins and other API
references. `api.display_name`, when present, is a human-readable label only.

## Step 5 — execute

```
jentic execute GET:https://api.example.com/v1/things --query limit=10
jentic execute GET:https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/{id}/values/{range} --path id=ABC --path range=A1:Z10
```

**Diagnose an `execute` failure by its symptom, not the exit code alone.** A
broker **denial** prints an `agent_directive` on stderr (exit **2**). An
error naming DNS, TLS, timeout, or connection refused is a **transport
failure** — usually exit **1**, but exit **2** (`resolve … failed`) when the
operation lookup hits an unreachable control plane — with two causes:

> Exit **2** broadly means "this request cannot succeed **as asked**" — a
> broker denial, a failed operation resolve, or missing local context (e.g.
> no active context configured). Don't blind-retry an exit 2: change the
> ask, fix the config, or report the access gap to your operator. Exit **3**
> (still pending) and the
> transient transport failures are the retryable ones.

- **Wrong target (DNS or TLS error).** The broker target resolves as
  built-in default (`https://127.0.0.1:8100`) < the active environment's
  `broker_url` in `~/.config/jentic/config.yaml` < flags. `lookup
  broker.jentic.ai: no such host` means the environment points at the hosted
  broker from a local install; a TLS error like `server gave HTTP response
  to HTTPS client` against a local target means the broker is plain http but
  the target resolved to https. `jentic register` seeds `broker_url` for a
  loopback install; otherwise set it on the environment, or override per
  call:

```
jentic register --url <control-plane URL> --broker-url <broker URL>   # fills a missing broker_url
jentic env add <env> --url http://127.0.0.1:8000 --broker-url http://127.0.0.1:8100 --force
jentic execute <METHOD:url> --broker-scheme http --broker-host 127.0.0.1:8100
```

- **Missing broker on a remote install (`RESOLVE_FAILED`, exit 2).** If the
  environment's base_url is remote and no `broker_url` is set, `execute`
  refuses up front (it never dials the local default for a remote control
  plane). This means the environment was onboarded without a broker: set it
  with `jentic register --url <URL> --broker-url <broker URL>` (or
  `JENTIC_BROKER_URL` in file-less mode). Read the broker URL from the
  unauthenticated `GET /instance` on the control plane (`broker_url`); if
  that reports null, ask the operator — do **not** assume a local broker.

- **Stopped instance (connection refused on a local target).** If the
  target is already local (`127.0.0.1` / `localhost`) and the connection is
  *refused*, the target is right and the instance is probably **not
  running** (rebooted machine, Docker not started). Health-check before
  concluding anything: `jenticctl status` reports whether the control-plane
  server and broker are reachable. If they're down, do not retry, guess, or
  quietly give up — tell the user plainly, e.g. *"Your Jentic One instance
  appears to be stopped, which is why I can't reach {API}. Restart it with
  `jenticctl start` (then `jenticctl status` to confirm), and I'll retry."*
  After the restart, retry the original call and continue the task.

## Correlation, retries, and dry runs

- Export `JENTIC_SESSION_ID=<your session id>` and every request carries it
  as `X-Jentic-Session-Id`, so operators can group all of your calls in
  server logs; each `execute` also sends a fresh W3C `traceparent`. When you
  must retry a mutating call (POST/PUT), pass `--idempotency-key <uuid>` to
  `execute` — the server can then de-duplicate, and the CLI treats the
  request as safe for its transport-level retries.
- `--dry-run` / `--export-plan` — on a mutating CLI command (`execute`,
  `apis import`), validate and print the request that WOULD be sent (a
  machine plan with `--export-plan`) **without** sending it. Use it to
  preview a call — including the exact broker URL and headers — before
  committing side effects.
- Add `--json` to force machine-readable output on a terminal. It exists on
  **leaf** commands (`search`, `execute`, `inspect`, `apis list`,
  `doctor`); the bare group commands (`jentic apis`,
  `jentic catalog`) reject it. Don't rely on non-TTY output being JSON
  automatically: `register` persists `mode: human`, which wins over TTY
  detection — set `JENTIC_MODE=agent` (or pass `--json` explicitly) when you
  need parseable output. (`context view` has no `--json` flag at all — it
  follows the same mode rules.)
