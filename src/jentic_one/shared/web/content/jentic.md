name: jentic
description: Use this skill whenever the user wants to work with a third-party or external API/tool through the Jentic platform — e.g. asks to "find the vessel-tracking API and add it", "get rows from this Google Sheet", connect Slack, import/search/discover an API, integrate or automate a SaaS, pull data from a service, or call an external endpoint. Prefer launching this before ToolSearch or hand-rolled HTTP: it drives the audited Jentic loop (identity → discover → check access → execute) over whichever Jentic surface the session has — `jentic` MCP tools or the `jentic` CLI — even inside a code repo. Do NOT use it for local-only work (editing code, finding files, adding a package/dependency, or questions with no external API call).

# Using Jentic

Jentic is an API broker: you discover operations across many APIs, then execute
them through a single authenticated gateway without managing each API's
credentials yourself. The same audited loop — identity → discover → check
access → execute — is exposed over two surfaces. This document is the
surface-neutral guide to the loop; the per-surface mechanics live in the
`references/` files next to it. **Work out which session you are in first**,
then load ONLY your lane's reference:

- **CLI session** — the `jentic` CLI is on PATH. Read `references/cli.md`
  for every command, flag, exit code, and failure diagnosis.
- **MCP session** — your session has `jentic` MCP **tools** (`whoami`,
  `search_apis`, `execute`, …). Read `references/mcp.md` for the tool
  surface, call shapes, envelopes, and recovery. (It also explains the
  stdio-vs-HTTP-mount tell — `get_started` present vs absent — and what each
  flavor can and cannot do.)
- For pitfalls, the command/tool cheatsheet, and verification checklists in
  both lanes, read `references/recovery.md`.

Both lanes drive the same loop against the same backend. The `instance`
stamp (`backend`/`host`/`instance_id`) on every MCP tool result — and the
unauthenticated `GET /instance` endpoint — is the which-backend-am-I-on
check; in a CLI session `jentic context view` reads the same facts.

## When to Use

- You need to call a third-party API (Stripe, GitHub, Slack, …) but don't have
  its SDK or credentials wired up.
- The user asks to **find, add, import, connect, or search for an API/tool**
  ("find the vessel-tracking API and add it", "get rows from this Google
  Sheet") — treat these as Jentic tasks, not local-repo or generic tool-search
  tasks, even when you are running inside a code repository.
- You want to discover what operations exist for a capability ("create a
  payment", "list pull requests") instead of reading raw OpenAPI specs.
- You are an agent that should drive real API calls through one audited broker.

Reach for your session's Jentic surface — the `jentic` MCP tools or the
`jentic` CLI — **before** generic tool discovery (`ToolSearch`) or
hand-rolling HTTP calls: the broker is the single audited path to external
APIs and handles credentials for you.

## Prerequisites

- A Jentic identity your human operator set up and a human approved — you
  never mint your own. How the credential is attached differs by lane (the
  CLI attaches a token; an MCP client presents an OAuth grant or bearer key
  per request); you never see or handle the raw credential in either lane.
- A reachable Jentic deployment (control plane + broker). Reachability and
  base-URL configuration are lane concerns — see your lane's reference file.
- **CLI session:** read `references/cli.md` before running commands — it is
  the command, flag, and environment contract for this lane.
- **MCP session:** read `references/mcp.md` before calling tools — it is the
  tool-surface and envelope contract for this lane.

## Procedure

Each step below is shared doctrine — what to do and in what order. The exact
commands (CLI) and tool calls (MCP) for every step are in `references/cli.md`
and `references/mcp.md`; follow your session's lane through every step and
never execute the other lane's verbs.

### 1. Confirm you have a valid identity

The exact commands (CLI) and tool calls (MCP) for this step and every step
after it are in `references/cli.md` and `references/mcp.md`; follow your
session's lane through every step and never execute the other lane's verbs.

You normally don't set up your own identity — your human operator connects
this agent to a Jentic install out-of-band (via `jentic register`/`jentic
setup` for a CLI machine, or by authorizing the MCP connection) and a human
approves it. First, check your setup: run your lane's identity check (CLI
`jentic doctor`; MCP `whoami`). If it reports a registered, approved
identity with a usable credential, move on to step 2.

If it does not (no context, not registered, pending approval, or an auth
error), **stop and relay to your operator** — registration and approval block
on a human and cannot be completed by an autonomous agent. Your lane's
reference names the exact recovery for each state.

### 2. Check what you can do, and report access gaps to your operator

Your identity view (CLI `jentic api GET /me`; MCP `whoami`) lists your
status, permissions, and credential bindings; each binding lists the APIs it
**serves** (`serves: [{api_vendor, api_name, api_version}]`). This tells you
exactly what you can already call. Combined with the catalog (what's
available to add — step 3), it's your map of the workspace.

**Decide access from that view first — do NOT execute an operation just to
see whether you have access.** A denied execute is a wasted round-trip; you
can tell in advance:

- If a binding already **serves** the API you need → you have access. Skip
  straight to inspect/execute.
- If **nothing** you're bound to serves it → you do **not** have access yet.
  Report the gap to your operator **before** your first execute — do not
  "try execute and branch on the denial".

**Report once, richly — never thrash.** Work out the full access end-state
up front — from your identity view, the catalog, and the task — and hand
your operator **one complete summary** covering every API the job needs, so
they can set it all up in one sitting. For each API name the
vendor/name (and version if you pinned one), the auth type the spec
declares, the operations you intend to call, and **why** — a clear one-liner
("fetch the user's open PRs to summarise them") is what gets you set up
faster.

**Starting the credential connection is something you CAN do — approval is
not.** When the missing credential is for a vendor in the deployment's
connect registry (GitHub, Google, …), start the connect session yourself:
run `jentic connect <vendor>` (CLI) or call `request_connection` (MCP). It
returns an `approval_url` — relay it to your operator, who opens it in
their browser and approves the connection and its scopes; you never open
or approve it. Once they confirm, re-check your identity view (`whoami`) —
an agent-initiated connect binds you at approval — and retry the blocked
call. For APIs outside the registry, and always for **binding an existing
credential or granting scopes**, the operator acts in the Jentic One
dashboard: granting is always a human action — you report (or start the
connect) and wait, you never grant yourself anything. Bindings take effect
live: once the operator confirms, retry the call that was blocked.

#### Proposing permission rules from the spec

Your access report is your chance to propose the credential's auth type and
its permission rules as a **first pass** — a human reviews and applies them
in the dashboard. Do the work up front: inspect the operations you intend to
call (step 4's lane verb) to read the methods, paths, and declared security
schemes; pick the auth type from what the spec declares (`bearer`,
`api_key`, `basic`, `oauth2`), or `none` if the API needs no credential;
then translate the user's plain-English intent into concrete `allow`/`deny`
rules with `methods`/`path` — "Read everything, write only to the prod
board" becomes
`[{"effect":"allow","methods":["GET"],"path":".*"}, {"effect":"allow","methods":["POST","PUT"],"path":"/boards/prod/.*"}]`.
An `allow` rule must constrain at least one of `methods`/`path`/`operations`.

**Be honest at the enforcement seam.** The broker matches a rule against the
request's HTTP method, URL path, and OpenAPI operation id — **never the
request body**. An intent that hinges on a body field ("only allow messages
to the #general channel" when the channel is a POST-body field) **cannot be
enforced** by these rules. Don't propose a rule that silently won't fire —
say so, and offer the real choices: allow the operation broadly (the human
accepts the wider grant), deny the operation entirely, or allow it and
record the constraint as instructions you follow yourself (unenforced).
Also sanity-check your proposal before relaying it: rules evaluate
first-match-wins, so an early broad `allow` shadows every rule after it, and
a rule set that contradicts the intent you stated in your reason will
confuse the human reviewing it. You never enter the credential secret and
you never grant — the human fills the secret in the dashboard and applies
the rules. You propose; they decide.

### 3. Find an operation (import first, then search)

Operation search only sees operations that have been **imported into this
deployment's local registry**. On a fresh install the registry is empty, so
a search returns `{"data": []}` until you import something. **Import before
you search** — if the user already named the API/vendor (e.g. "Google
Sheets"), go straight to the catalog; don't search an empty registry first
and waste a call. The discovery order is: browse the public catalog for an
importable API → import the one you want (auto-promotes to live) → search
the local registry.

Importing an **already-cataloged** API is gated on `catalog:import`, which
an approved agent holds **by default** — no operator round-trip needed. Just
run the import. Re-importing an API that is already there is safe — the registry
state **converges** either way — but the surfaces report the duplicate
differently (a success on the HTTP mount, a dead-letter "identical content
already exists" error on the stdio server and the CLI); your lane's
reference names the exact shape. Treat it as "already there" — don't retry,
and don't invent a made-up "catalog read" permission to ask for: reading
the registry and importing a cataloged API need no grant.

**Before concluding "the data is gone", confirm which backend you're on.**
If APIs or credentials you *know* existed appear missing — or IDs
look unfamiliar — you may be talking to a **different** backend than you
expect: a hosted (`remote`) install and a `local` self-hosted one have
independent registries and credentials, and each surface in your session can
be bound to a different one. Check the `instance` stamp (MCP) or
`jentic context view` / `GET /instance` (CLI) and repoint the client at the
right base URL rather than importing/searching again.

### 4. Inspect the operation's contract

Resolve an operation to its method, path, parameters, and schemas before
calling it (CLI `jentic inspect`; MCP `inspect_operation`). Pass the
search hit's `target` verbatim — a `METHOD:url` pair such as
`GET:https://api.example.com/v1/things`. Always inspect
before you execute — the contract names the parameters and the security
requirements you'll propose rules against.

### 5. Execute through the broker

Send the request through the Jentic broker (CLI `jentic execute`; MCP
`execute` / `execute_read`). The broker is a transparent forward proxy, so
the target is the **full upstream URL** (scheme + host + path), not a
host-relative path. Pass the same `target` (`METHOD:URL`) from the
search step. The broker authenticates you and injects the stored
upstream credential server-side; credentials never pass through your
session.

A held or async execution does not answer inline: it returns a **job
envelope** (`{job_id, status, …}`). Poll the job until its status is
terminal — and **never re-send the original call while a job is pending**:
approval happens out-of-band, and re-sending duplicates the side effect.

A denied or failed execute carries a coded recovery (the CLI's stderr
`agent_directive` + exit codes; MCP's coded error envelopes). Follow the
directive/envelope rather than assuming which recovery applies — the denial
taxonomy and its per-code recoveries are in your lane's reference. Diagnose
a failure by its symptom, not by assuming access: transport failures
(DNS/TLS/refused) and denials recover differently.

## Quick Reference

- The loop, in either lane: identity check → decide access from your
  bindings (report gaps to your operator in ONE summary) → catalog import →
  registry search → inspect → execute through the broker.
- CLI session: the full command cheatsheet is in `references/cli.md` (and
  `jentic --help` is always current); MCP session: the 9 mount tools / 10
  stdio tools with one-line whens are in `references/mcp.md`.
- Both cheatsheets, side by side with pitfalls and verification, are in
  `references/recovery.md`.

## Pitfalls

- Executing before the agent is registered/approved fails — there is no
  usable identity. Run your lane's identity check and relay the recovery to
  your operator; nothing you can call completes an approval.
- An empty search result (`{"data": []}`) usually means **nothing is
  imported yet**, not that you lack access. Go through the catalog, then
  search again.
- **Don't execute to test access.** Your identity view already tells you
  what your bindings **serve**; if the API you need isn't there, report the
  gap to your operator and wait. The recovery directive is a fallback for
  surprises, not a discovery step.
- Access is granted by a human: your operator approves every connection and
  binds you in the dashboard. You can *start* a registry vendor's connect
  session yourself (`jentic connect <vendor>` / `request_connection`), but
  you can't approve it, bind an existing credential, or grant yourself
  scopes.
- **Verify which backend you're talking to before diagnosing "missing" APIs
  or credentials** — compare `instance` stamps (see step 3) and stick to one
  surface for the whole task.
- The lane-specific pitfall lists (broker-URL/DNS diagnosis, stopped
  instances, job-pending rules, envelope caveats) are in
  `references/recovery.md` — read your lane's section before debugging.

## Verification

- Your lane's identity check answers with a registered, approved identity.
- After importing an API from the catalog, a registry search for something
  in that API returns at least one result.
- A known-allowed read executed through the broker returns a 2xx response.
- The lane-specific checklists (exact commands and tool calls) are in
  `references/recovery.md`.
