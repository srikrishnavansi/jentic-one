"""Public agent-discovery documents: the served skill set and ``llms.txt``.

Serves the shipped skill set over HTTP so an agent that can reach a deployment
can self-onboard from the base URL alone — no manual copying of a CLI-generated
skill file, no drift from the running version:

- ``GET /skills/{name}.md`` — the raw markdown of any shipped skill (allowlisted
  to the set globbed from package data). ``GET /SKILL.md`` is a legacy alias for
  the ``jentic`` onboarding skill.
- ``GET /skills/{name}/references/{file}.md`` — a skill's level-3 reference
  documents (lane/variant material its SKILL.md points at), same allowlist
  posture. HTTP serves ALL references — it is the raw neutral channel; the
  lane filter (``CLI_ONLY_REFERENCES``) applies only to MCP resource listings.
- ``GET /skills/index.json`` — a manifest of the set: ``name``, ``description``,
  ``version``, raw-bytes ``sha256``, and a base-stamped absolute ``url`` —
  plus, for skills that ship references, a ``references`` array
  (``{name, sha256, url}`` per file; omitted when empty).
- ``GET /llms.txt`` (alias ``GET /.well-known/llms.txt``) — an ``llms.txt`` index
  linking every discovery document, including a ``## Skills`` section.

The served set is the same canonical content the CLI embeds and renders into
agent runtimes (``cli/internal/skillgen/content/<name>.md``); a drift test pins
the copies to each other (``tests/arch/test_skill_drift.py``). The single source
of truth for the *backend* served set is the shipped ``content/*.md`` package
data, globbed at runtime — deliberately NOT an import of the repo-root ``tools``
package, which is not shipped in the wheel.

The backend serves each skill's RAW bytes verbatim: BaseURL is a render-time
concern owned only by the CLI, so nothing here interpolates it.

Hidden from the OpenAPI schema, like ``GET /reference/endpoints.json``: these
are tooling/onboarding documents, not a product API.

Split deployments: the router is mounted on every surface app, but the links
in ``llms.txt`` span surfaces (auth, registry, control), so standalone
surfaces should set ``server.public_base_url`` (or ``auth.canonical_base_url``)
to the gateway URL — otherwise
the rendered links point at the single surface's own host and may 404 there.

> it.

Agents: read the onboarding skill at {base}{SKILL_PATH} first. It is the
canonical guide to the identity → discover → check access → execute loop —
the same canonical guide the `jentic` CLI renders into agent runtimes — and
its `references/` files (listed in the skills index) carry the per-surface
detail.

{mcp_paragraph}

If your session has `jentic` MCP tools, prefer them; use the `jentic` CLI for
`setup`/`doctor` recovery and anything not exposed over MCP. Both surfaces
talk to the same instance — check `backend`/`host` in the identity stamp on
MCP tool results (or `GET {base}/instance`) if in doubt.

## Quickstart (agent onboarding)

Prefer the `jentic` CLI where available: your operator runs `jentic setup`
(registers this agent, waits for human approval, installs the skill), then you
drive `jentic search` → `jentic inspect` → `jentic execute`. The raw HTTP
sequence is:

1. Register (RFC 7591): generate an Ed25519 keypair, then
   `POST {base}/register` with
   `{{"client_name": "<agent name>", "jwks": {{"keys": [<public key as JWK>]}}}}`.
   The response carries `client_id` and a `registration_access_token`; a human
   operator must approve the registration.
2. Poll approval (RFC 7592): `GET {base}/register/{{client_id}}` with
   `Authorization: Bearer <registration_access_token>` until `status` is
   `active` (it starts as `pending`; `rejected` means a human denied the
   registration).
3. Get a token: `POST {base}/oauth/token` with a JSON body (not form-encoded):
   `{{"grant_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer",
   "assertion": "<EdDSA-signed JWT>"}}`. Assertion claims: `iss` = your
   `client_id`, `aud` = `{base}/oauth/token`, `exp` at most
   {assertion_max_ttl_seconds} seconds in the future, and a unique `jti`
   (required — replayed or missing `jti` values are rejected).
4. Discover: `POST {base}/search` to search operations across APIs;
   `GET {base}/apis` to list registered APIs;
   `GET {base}/reference/endpoints.json` for the full endpoint + permission map.
5. Check access: `GET {base}/me` lists the credentials you are bound to. If
   the API you need isn't covered, report the gap to your human operator —
   they connect the credential and bind it to you in the dashboard.
6. Execute by sending the request through the broker's forward proxy with the
   full upstream URL (the broker runs on its own host/port — see the skill's
   execute section). The CLI's `jentic execute` is the equivalent audited
   path. Credentials are injected by the broker, never handled by you.
