    3. Otherwise -> owner == self.

    ``bound_credential_ids`` widens visibility for the ``Credential`` model:
    an agent may always read a credential it holds an active (non-suspended)
    ``agent_credential_bindings`` row for — regardless of owner scoping
    (issues #665/#682). This matters for an orphaned agent
    (``created_by``/owner ``None``) that owns nothing yet is legitimately
    bound to a credential. Bindings live in the admin DB, so the service
    resolves the ids there (via
    :meth:`PrerequisiteRepository.list_credential_ids_for_agent`) and passes
    them in; this module stays single-DB and free of admin imports.
    ``None``/empty leaves the owner-only behaviour unchanged. Read call sites
    only; writes stay owner-scoped.

    ``include_shared`` (READ call sites only) invokes any registered
    access-filter providers (see :func:`register_access_filter_provider`) and
    OR-merges their clauses — e.g. an extension's "shared-with-me" grant. It must
    NOT be set on write call sites, so a sharee can see but never mutate. With no
    providers registered (stock OSS) it is a no-op.
