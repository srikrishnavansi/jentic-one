"""Repository for theme-8 Phase 1 service-account → agent migration.

The migration job runs in the control module (it copies the per-binding
inline permission rules in the control DB) but does nearly all of its work in
the **admin** DB (successor agents, credential digests, grant and
binding twins, token revocation, the stamp, the sweep, and the pre-drop
verification queries). The control module must not import admin ORM
models, so every admin-side statement
here is raw SQL (F1 is also served by this: successor creation must never go
through ``AgentService.create()``/``approve()``, whose empty-scope default is
``DEFAULT_AGENT_SCOPES``).

Concurrency (H-A x F6): the caller wraps each SA in one admin transaction
(``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` on SQLite via ``DatabaseSession.transaction``);
``acquire_migration_lock`` adds a Postgres ``pg_advisory_xact_lock`` fast
path (documented no-op on SQLite). The real double-mint backstop is the
``uq_agent_credentials_api_key_hash`` unique partial index — a losing
concurrent insert fails the transaction, never a partial write.
