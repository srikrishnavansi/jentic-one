        Theme-5 Phase 3 successor of the toolkit-era ``resolve_toolkits_for_api``
        — the join through ``toolkit_credential_bindings`` is gone; the
        candidate axis is the credential itself. An empty ``name``/``version``
        reference axis means "any"; a NULL ``api_name``/``api_version`` on the
        credential means it covers all names/versions for the vendor.

        **Owner axis (hard problem 8):** the toolkit era scoped candidates by
        the *toolkit's* owner (``tk.created_by``). Dropping the join must not
        silently narrow resolution to "credentials I own" — a decider may
        legitimately govern another owner's credential through an agent they
        own that is already bound to it (the binding-widened visibility of
        ``scoping/filters._binding_visibility_clause``). A credential is a
        candidate when the decider **owns it** (``created_by IN owner_ids``)
        **or** it appears in ``bound_credential_ids`` — the ids of credentials
        bound to agents the decider owns, resolved by the caller from the
        admin DB (`list_bound_credential_ids_for_owned_agents`) and pushed
        down here as a plain id list (the cross-DB seam of hard problem 9; no
        admin table is referenced in this query).

        ``owner_ids`` is ``None`` only for an ``org:admin`` decider, who may
        resolve across all owners (``bound_credential_ids`` is then irrelevant).
        Passing an empty list for both returns no candidates.

        To avoid widening a name-specific reference into a vendor-wide
        (``api_name IS NULL``) credential, an **exact** name/version match is
        preferred: NULL-wildcard credentials only contribute when no exact
        match exists for the requested name (#775).

        The ``vendor``/``name`` reference axes are canonicalized (slugified)
        here before binding, because stored rows are canonical (the credential
        service slugifies on write and the backfill migration re-slugs legacy
        rows) — a raw reference like ``GitHub.com`` must be slugified to
        ``github-com`` or it would match nothing (#656). ``version`` is trimmed
        but never slugified, matching ``canonical_credential_scope``.
