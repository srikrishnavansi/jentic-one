"""Theme-5 Phase 6a — the toolkit-flattening job (no drops).

Derives direct ``agent_credential_bindings`` rows (plus shared
``permission_rule_sets``) from the legacy toolkit graph: every
``(agent, credential)`` pair reachable via ``agent_toolkit_bindings ⋈
toolkit_credential_bindings`` gains a direct binding carrying the pair's
effective rules from ``toolkit_permission_rules``. Output is shaped exactly
like a hand-created binding (same tables, same rule-set indirection), so the
broker's direct path serves flattened and hand-made pairs identically.

Semantics for the two ways the legacy model cannot be flattened soundly
(theme plan, hard problem 2):

- **Same-pair rule conflicts** — a pair reachable via two toolkits whose
  per-pair rule lists diverge has no correct automatic merge (ordered
  first-match-wins lists). The job prefers the SAFER outcome: the binding is
  created **default-deny** (no rule set, no inline rules) and a
  ``rule_conflict`` report line embeds every contributing list verbatim for
  the operator to resolve.
- **Pooled-vs-per-pair drift** — the legacy broker pooled rules per
  ``(toolkit, api_vendor)``, so a vendor-wide rule authored on one binding
  also governed sibling same-vendor credentials. The direct model is strictly
  per-pair. The job writes the per-pair list (the target model) and emits a
  ``pooled_rule_drift`` line wherever the pooled list differs, embedding both
  lists verbatim.

Ordering and idempotency: rules are written **control-first**, bindings
**admin-last**, so a crash mid-run leaves orphan rule sets — never a live
rule-less binding — and a re-run skips pairs that already exist (the natural
``UNIQUE (agent_id, credential_id)`` on the binding). Quiescing bind/unbind
is not practical in OSS, so concurrency is handled by double-run-and-diff:
run the job, run it again, and assert the second run reports zero creations
(``--diff-only`` previews without writing).

Bindings reachable only through **inactive** toolkits are live access on the
legacy path (``toolkits.active`` never gated bound agents) — they are
migrated like any other pair AND reported loudly, never skipped.

Run once automatically by the migration runner as an upgrade step
(``control/services/upgrade_steps.py``), so an upgrade lands with every
toolkit-reachable pair already bound directly — the broker's default
direct-binding path would otherwise authorize none of them. The operator CLI
(``jentic_one flatten-toolkits``) stays for previews, re-runs after toolkit
changes made on an older version mid-rollout, and verification. The Phase-6b
acknowledgement is never automatic: the drops stay gated on an explicit
operator ``--verify --acknowledge`` (which writes the ``toolkit_flattening_acks``
sentinel row 6b's migrations check).
