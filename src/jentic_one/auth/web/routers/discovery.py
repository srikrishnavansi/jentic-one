"""OAuth discovery and JWKS endpoints (RFC 8414 + RFC 9728).

Two discovery surfaces live here:

- The **root** RFC 8414 document (``/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server``)
  — the platform AS metadata whose ``registration_endpoint`` is the *agent*
  DCR door ``/register``. Its body is pinned byte-identical by a golden
  regression test: do not change it when touching the
  MCP-scoped documents below.
- The **/mcp-scoped** documents: a path-scoped RFC 8414
  doc for the logical issuer ``{base}/mcp`` plus the RFC 9728
  protected-resource doc (path-scoped and a root alias). All are gated by
  ``server.mcp.oauth.enabled`` — off (the default) they answer the
  framework's plain route-not-found 404, so the *gate state* is unobservable.
  (The *build* still shows routing-level tells — 405+``Allow`` on
  non-registered methods, the slash redirect, the doc paths in the live
  OpenAPI schema — identical in both gate arms; pinned by tests.) The ``/mcp``
  401 challenge that starts the discovery chain moved to the mounted
  MCP app (``jentic_one.mcp``) together with the path itself.

      validates against the MCP server URL (``{base}/mcp``), which is exactly
      what the alias exists to satisfy. That is the intended trade.
    - The alias squats the deployment's only root PRM slot: a future non-MCP
      protected resource at ``{base}`` cannot get its own root document
