"""Anonymous OAuth-client Dynamic Client Registration service (RFC 7591 subset).

The anonymous-DCR design (D1/D6/D8/D9): the front door behind ``POST
/oauth-clients``. It writes **public** (secret-less, PKCE-only) rows into the
same ``oauth_clients`` registry the admin CRUD manages — always
``consent_model='agent'`` and ``registration_source='dcr'``. Rows land
``approval_status='pending'`` + ``active=false`` unless the D9 auto-approve
policy (``server.mcp.oauth.auto_approve_clients``) applies.

Distinct from :mod:`jentic_one.auth.services.registration_service`, which is
the *agent* DCR endpoint (``POST /register``) and stays byte-identical.

        every awaiting-approval retry. Never dedupes on ``software_id`` or
        ``client_name`` alone, and never across the two key spaces.

        and denied rows are never touched: retries of a pending client stay
        queue-quiet (G13), and a denied row re-attaches denied (recovery is

        NULL) — a row in *neither* key space that re-opens the #1251 loop.
