"""The mounted ``/mcp`` ASGI app: gate, Origin check, bearer auth, transport.

A **stateless** Streamable HTTP endpoint (spec revision
2026-07-28 — no session state, no ``Mcp-Session-Id``, connection-independent
``tools/list``) built on the official ``mcp`` SDK's low-level ``Server`` +
``StreamableHTTPSessionManager(stateless=True)``, wrapped in a thin ASGI gate
that owns everything the platform — not the SDK — must decide:

- **The config gate.** ``server.mcp.enabled`` off keeps the path answering
  the framework's plain route-not-found 404 — or,
  when ``server.mcp.oauth.enabled`` is on, the RFC 9728 discovery challenge
  (401 + ``WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata=…``) the challenge
  placeholder owned. The four on/off arms are pinned by tests
  (``tests/unit/mcp/test_mount_gate.py``).
- **Sub-path fall-through.** Only ``/mcp`` itself is served — the installer
  registers an exact-path ``Route``, never a prefix ``Mount``, so every
  sub-path (notably the ``/mcp/.well-known/…`` discovery probe variants,
  pinned by tests) keeps answering the framework's plain 404 in every arm
  and clients keep landing on the served RFC 8414 path-insertion documents.
- **Strict Origin validation** (spec §security, DNS-rebinding): a request
  carrying an ``Origin`` that is neither the config-derived canonical origin
  (``auth.canonical_base_url``, else ``server.public_base_url`` — the same
  source the discovery documents build absolute URLs from) nor loopback is
  refused with 403 before anything else runs. The request's own ``Host``
  header is never trusted — in the rebinding attack it is attacker-controlled.
  Absent ``Origin`` (non-browser clients — every real MCP client today)
  passes.
- **Bearer auth** reusing the identity-resolution LOGIC — the app-state
  ``verify_token`` the auth surface installs (``make_superset_verifier``),
  which resolves ``jak_`` API keys (retired ``sak_`` ones are refused), ``at_``
  access tokens (including
  grant-channel bearers: actor=agent with ``oauth_grant_id``, resolved
  through the same gates as every REST call) — NOT the ``get_current_identity``
  FastAPI dependency: a Starlette mount is a separate ASGI app, so parent
  route dependencies never run here. A missing/invalid credential answers the
  same 401 challenge contract as the placeholder (the ``resource_metadata`` pointer riding
  only when the OAuth discovery surface is on to serve it) — EXCEPT a
  credential-less GET/HEAD, which answers the stream refusal (405) instead:
  this endpoint never offers a GET stream (stateless), so an unauthenticated
  GET could never receive one even after authenticating, and challenging it
  makes SDK-based proxy clients (``mcp-remote`` ≤ 0.8.3) launch concurrent
  OAuth flows off their fallback-test/main GET-stream arms that clobber each
  other's PKCE verifier — guaranteed ``invalid_grant``
  (https://github.com/jentic/jentic-one/issues/1256). A request that DOES
  present a credential (any ``Authorization`` header or API-key header, even
  a garbage one) keeps the challenge contract on every method.
- **The pre-auth whitelist**: ``tools/list``, the SDK's legacy ``initialize``
  fallback (+ ``notifications/initialized``), ``ping``, and the public
  ``skill://`` resource surface (listings AND reads — the same documents
  ``GET /skills/*`` serves without a credential) are served without a
  credential — a client can always discover the tool surface and read the
  skill set before authenticating. Everything else
  requires a resolved identity.
- **Session telemetry**: each authenticated POST feeds the
  windowed ``mcp.session_started`` emit — key = (agent identity x ``_meta``
  clientInfo x window), fire-and-forget
  (:func:`jentic_one.shared.events.mcp_session.schedule_mcp_http_session_emit`).

The resolved identity/credential ride to the tool handlers on the request's
ASGI ``scope["state"]`` (the SDK transport attaches the Starlette ``Request``
to each handler's ``ServerRequestContext.request``) — never a contextvar: the
stateless session manager runs handlers on a task group created at startup,
whose context predates the request.

#: The RFC 9728 protected-resource metadata path for the ``/mcp`` resource —
#: must stay in lockstep with ``auth/web/routers/discovery._MCP_PRM_PATH``.
MCP_PRM_PATH = "/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp"

#: JSON-RPC methods served WITHOUT a credential: discovery of the tool
#: surface, the spec's ping, the legacy-``initialize`` fallback pair, and the
#: public skill-resource surface (listings + reads). ``resources/read`` is
#: pre-auth because the readable set is the public skill set and NOTHING
#: else — the same documents ``GET /skills/*`` already serves without a
#: credential, so the pre-auth read adds zero new exposure. Three layers of
#: defense hold that property (``tests/unit/mcp/test_resources.py``):
#:
#: 1. **Resolver characterization (the proof)** — ``read_skill_resource`` is
#:    unit-characterized as three-armed by construction: every URI outside
#:    ``skill://<shipped name>`` + ``skill://<shipped name>/references/<file>``
#:    (lane-filtered: never a ``CLI_ONLY_REFERENCES`` file) + ``skill://index``
#:    raises -32002, and no branch of it can see a credential (it never reads
#:    identity), so its behavior is structurally identical pre- and post-auth.
#: 2. **Delegation pin (the structural lock)** — ``on_read_resource`` below
#:    is pinned to be a bare delegation to ``read_skill_resource``, so this
#:    module cannot grow a bypass arm without failing a test.
#: 3. **Probe battery (the tripwire)** — a mount-level battery of hostile
#:    URIs answers -32002 twice, credential-less and with a valid bearer.
#:
#: In SDK 2.1.1 every ``resources/read`` dispatches to the ONE handler
#: (there is no per-resource routing), so a future non-public resource would
#: need a NEW handler arm — no finite probe battery can prove such an arm
#: doesn't exist, so a new arm is exactly what code review plus this comment
#: must catch: if you are adding one, take ``resources/read`` back OFF this
#: whitelist first and re-review the pre-auth door. The arm has THREE doors,
#: not one: here in ``build_mcp_server`` (the delegation pin catches that),
#: inside ``read_skill_resource`` itself (``resources.py`` — a third resolver
#: arm passes both the pin and every probe, so review must watch that module
#: with the same eyes), or via the SDK's
#: ``Server.add_request_handler("resources/read", …)``, which replaces the
#: registered handler after ``build_mcp_server`` returns and bypasses this
#: module entirely (``tests/arch/test_mcp_handler_registration.py`` pins that
#: nothing under ``src/`` calls it).
