"""Actor liveness and permission lookup for work that runs after the request is gone.

The sync execute path learns whether its caller is still active — and still
holds the execute permission — from credential resolution (``InProcessTokenResolver``
/ ``ApiKeyResolver`` re-read the actor row and, for agents, the live
``actor_permission_grants`` on every resolve). A queued execution
has no credential to resolve when the worker picks it up, so this answers the
same questions directly from the actor rows, with the same semantics:

- ``agent`` → ``agents.status = 'active'`` (suspended/archived/missing → inactive);
- ``user`` → ``users.active`` (disabled/missing → inactive);
- anything else → inactive. That covers the retired ``toolkit`` and
  ``service_account`` identities (theme 8 Phase 4 dropped the
  service-account tables; a job queued under one can never run).

Raw SQL against the admin schema — the broker may not import the ``admin`` ORM.
