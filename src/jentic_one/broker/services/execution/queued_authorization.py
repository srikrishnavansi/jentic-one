"""Worker-time authorization for queued (``Prefer: respond-async``) executions.

The sync execute route authorizes a request against the state of the world at
request time. A queued execution runs later, on the worker — so it is
re-authorized there, with the **same** policy (:func:`authorize_execution`),
before any credential is resolved:

1. the enqueuing actor must still be active (the sync path's token-resolution
   check, answered from the actor row since the worker holds no token);
2. an agent must still hold the execute permission (the sync path's
   ``require_execute_permission``, answered from the live grant rows an agent's
   credentials resolve their scopes from);
3. the actor's bindings for the API are re-derived, so a removed or
   suspended binding (or a disabled credential) no longer resolves;
4. the binding's permission rules are re-evaluated for the operation.

A denial becomes a :class:`QueuedExecutionVerdict` carrying the problem body
the sync route would have returned; the worker records it and never injects.
Implements the shared ``ExecutionAuthorizer`` protocol.
