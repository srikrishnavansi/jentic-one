"""drop agent_toolkit_bindings + sweep retired toolkit scopes (theme-5 phase 6b)

The admin half of the deletion cut. Two pieces:

1. **Drop ``agent_toolkit_bindings``** — the legacy agent↔toolkit binding
   table. Guard-and-raise (never skip — Alembic would stamp the revision and
   nothing would retry): the drop proceeds only when the table is empty
   (fresh installs / CI), or when there is evidence the flattening ran:

   - **Control acknowledgement readable** (PostgreSQL with the control schema
     in the same database and readable by this connection's role): a
     qualifying ``toolkit_flattening_acks`` row must exist — written by a
     Phase-6b ``flatten-toolkits --verify --acknowledge`` (so
     ``execution_names_backfilled`` is true) whose ``admin_state_digest``
     matches the ``agent_toolkit_bindings`` rows present now (so a binding
     added after the ack refuses the drop). Catalog-only probing: a role
     without access sees no table and falls through, never errors.
   - **Otherwise** (SQLite, separate databases, or per-surface roles — the
     default deployment): an in-DB proxy for "the flattening ran" — at least
     one row in ``agent_credential_bindings``. Every legacy
     ``(agent, credential)`` pair the flattening job derives lands as a
     direct binding, so legacy bindings alongside **zero** direct bindings
     means it clearly has not run. The control drop (``f3c4d5e6a7b8``)
     enforces the strict acknowledgement gate, and a full ``migrations.run``
     migrates control before admin, so the proxy is a second line, not the
     only line.

2. **Scope-data sweep** — the retired ``toolkits:read`` / ``toolkits:write``
   / ``owner:toolkits:read`` scope strings are purged from every stored
   grant/token surface: ``actor_scope_grants`` (one scope per row → rows
   deleted), ``user_permission_grants`` (same), and the array/string carriers
   ``access_tokens.scopes``, ``refresh_tokens.scopes``,
   ``oauth_client_grants.scopes``, ``oauth_clients.allowed_scopes`` (JSON
   arrays, rewritten minus the retired entries) and
   ``authorization_codes.scopes`` (space-separated string). Holding a retired
   scope has granted nothing since Phase 5b (``RETIRED_SCOPES`` is
   accept-and-ignore); this sweep removes the strings so the tolerance set
   itself can eventually retire. Array rewrites run in Python (dialect-safe
   for Postgres JSONB and SQLite JSON-as-TEXT alike), prefiltered by a
   LIKE probe so unaffected rows are never rewritten.

``downgrade()`` recreates ``agent_toolkit_bindings`` empty in its final
historical shape (post ``s8t9u0v1w2x3`` toolkit_id index, ``q6r7s8t9u0v1``
nullable created_by, ``b9d0e1f2a3b4`` FK-less agent_id). Rows come back only
via ``jentic_one export-toolkits --import <file>`` — see the rollback
runbook in ``docs/development/releasing.md``. The scope sweep is not reversed: the
strings granted nothing.
