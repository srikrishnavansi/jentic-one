# Import a New API (spec → local registry → import-openapi-specs repo → import issue)

Import an API that is **not yet in [jentic-public-apis](https://github.com/jentic/jentic-public-apis)**:
generate an OpenAPI spec from the vendor's docs, optionally import it into the **local Jentic
registry first** (so the user's agent can execute it immediately), then publish it to the user's
single reusable public repo `import-openapi-specs` and open the import issue that drives it into
the community catalog.

This is the greenfield counterpart to `contribute-spec-fix` (which fixes a spec already in the
catalog). Use `contribute-spec-fix` when the vendor already exists; use this skill when it does not.

Target: `$ARGUMENTS` (a vendor name like `firecrawl`, or a URL to the vendor's API docs). If only
a company name is given, find its public API docs by searching for `<company> API documentation`.

## Prerequisites

- `gh` CLI authenticated (`gh auth status`) with `repo` scope. Note which account is **active** —
  the spec repo is created there and its raw links must resolve publicly.
- No local jentic-public-apis checkout needed — the vendor-existence check runs against GitHub
  via `gh`.
- For the optional local-first step only: a running Jentic control plane and a registered agent
  identity (`jentic doctor` confirms a resolvable identity with a usable token; `jentic api GET
  /me` shows what you can do).

## Steps

### 1. Confirm the vendor is NOT already in the catalog (hard gate)

Check the live repo, not a local checkout:

```
gh api "repos/jentic/jentic-public-apis/contents/apis/openapi" --paginate \
  --jq '.[].name' | grep -i '<vendor-guess>'
```

Try the real domain (`firecrawl.dev`), bare name (`firecrawl`), and obvious variants (with and
without subdomains: `api.foo.com` vs `foo.com`). **If a matching vendor directory exists, STOP**
and tell the user — re-importing produces a duplicate, and the import workflow hard-fails on an
existing version directory anyway. Point them at `contribute-spec-fix` if they meant to fix the
existing spec, or offer a genuinely-absent alternative.

### 2. Generate the OpenAPI spec

Two paths, in strict priority order:

1. **Path 1 — look for an official spec first.** Probe `https://{domain}/openapi.json`,
   `/swagger.json`, `api.{domain}/openapi.json`, and the vendor's GitHub org
   (`raw.githubusercontent.com/{org}/{repo}/main/.../openapi.json`). Vendors often ship a spec
   in-repo (Firecrawl publishes one at `firecrawl/firecrawl/apps/api/openapi.json`). If found,
   download it, validate it has a top-level `openapi`/`swagger` key, and **add
   `info.x-jentic-source-url`** pointing at where it came from. Done — do not hand-generate.
2. **Path 2 — generate from docs** only if no official spec exists. Extract every endpoint,
   method, path/query/body param, and auth scheme; build valid OpenAPI 3.0.3 with response/error
   schemas referenced via `$ref`, root-level `security`, and `securitySchemes` under `components`.

In both paths, embed **`info.x-vendor`** = the vendor domain (e.g. `firecrawl.dev`) next to
`info.x-jentic-source-url` — the local registry's ingest resolves vendor from `x-vendor` (falling
back to `contact.name`) and fails with `missing vendor` without it.

**Validate** before moving on: parses as JSON/YAML, has `openapi`, `info.title`, and `paths` with
≥1 path; note the server URL.

**Private-host refusal (do not skip).** If any `servers[].url` points at a private or internal
host, **refuse to publish and stop after the local-first step**:

```
python3 -c "
import json,sys,re
spec=json.load(open('<spec>.json'))
bad=re.compile(r'localhost|127\.|10\.|172\.(1[6-9]|2[0-9]|3[01])\.|192\.168\.|\.(internal|local|corp|lan)([/:]|$)')
hosts=[s.get('url','') for s in spec.get('servers',[])]
print('PRIVATE' if any(bad.search(h) for h in hosts) else 'OK', hosts)"
```

`PRIVATE` means this looks like an internal API — publishing it to a public repo would disclose
it. Tell the user why you stopped; only continue if they explicitly confirm the API is public.

Decide the layout parts (used verbatim as the repo path, deterministically):
- **vendor.domain** — the real registrable domain with TLD (`firecrawl.dev`), lowercase, no
  scheme, no `www.`, no API subdomain (`api.foo.com` → `foo.com`). Not a slug.
- **api-slug** — from `info.title`: lowercase, spaces and `/` → hyphens, strip any character that
  is not `[a-z0-9-]`, collapse repeats (`Firecrawl API` → `firecrawl-api`).
- **version** — `info.version` verbatim (`1.0.0`, `v1.2`, `2023-01-01` are all fine as directory
  names); `1.0.0` only when the spec has none.

### 3. Local-first: import into the local Jentic registry (optional)

If a local jentic-one instance is running, import the spec there **before** contributing
upstream — the user's agent can execute the API immediately instead of waiting on catalog
review. Skip this step if `jentic doctor` reports the control plane unreachable.

Local import needs the `apis:write` permission, which is not granted by default — ask your operator
to grant it to this agent in the dashboard. Granted permissions bake into your token at mint time, so
once they confirm run `jentic logout` (it clears only the cached token, not your identity) and the
next call mints a fresh token carrying the permission; then continue.

Import the spec with the CLI's own upload command — it reads the local file and sends it inline
for you (async; prints a job id). Pass `--vendor`/`--name`/`--version` explicitly so attribution
does not depend on how ingest slugifies `info`:

```
jentic apis import <spec>.json --vendor <vendor> --name <name> --version <version>
```

If you specifically want the raw POST instead, the auth-attached passthrough builds the same
inline payload (the CLI attaches the bearer for you; V2 never exposes a token):

```
jentic api POST /apis -d "$(jq -n --rawfile spec <spec>.json \
  '{sources:[{type:"inline",content:$spec,filename:"openapi.json"}]}')"
```

Poll `jentic api GET /jobs/<job_id>` until `completed`, read the revision id from
`jentic api GET /jobs/<job_id>/result`, then promote the draft to live:

```
jentic apis promote <vendor/name/version> <revision_id>
```

**Verify**: `jentic search "<something the API does>"` returns one of its operations, and a
known-safe `jentic execute <METHOD:URL from the search hit>` succeeds (credentials permitting — see the `jentic`
skill). The user is now unblocked; the remaining steps contribute the spec to the community.

### 4. Publish the spec to the reusable `import-openapi-specs` repo

> **CONSENT GATE — publishing is public and under the user's name.** Before creating or pushing
> anything, show the user: the vendor and API title, every `servers[].url`, the path count, the
> exact repo path the file will land at, and the fact that `import-openapi-specs` is a **public**
> repo on **their** GitHub account. Ask for explicit confirmation. Do not proceed on silence.
> If the spec was generated from docs behind a login, or the private-host check in step 2 printed
> `PRIVATE`, treat "no" as the default.

**Secrets scan (before any commit).** Docs examples sometimes embed real keys; refuse to publish
if the spec contains anything that looks like a credential:

```
grep -nE '(api[_-]?key|secret|token|password)["'\'':= ]+[A-Za-z0-9_/+-]{16,}' <spec>.json \
  && echo "POSSIBLE SECRET — inspect before publishing" || echo "clean"
```

The user keeps **one** public repo named `import-openapi-specs` on their own account for all
their imports — created **once**, then reused. Each API lands in its own
`{vendor.domain}/{api-slug}/{version}/` subtree, so specs never overwrite one another. Clone to
a predictable location in both branches:

```
account=$(gh api user --jq .login)
rm -rf /tmp/import-openapi-specs
if gh repo view "$account/import-openapi-specs" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "Reusing existing $account/import-openapi-specs"
else
  gh repo create "$account/import-openapi-specs" --public \
    --description "OpenAPI specs staged for jentic-public-apis import"
fi
gh repo clone "$account/import-openapi-specs" /tmp/import-openapi-specs -- -q
```

If `gh repo view` finds a repo by that name that is clearly **not** a spec-staging repo (it has
unrelated content), stop and ask the user for an alternative name rather than committing into it.

Lay the spec out and push to `main` (the import workflow fetches whatever public raw URL you give
it — no special branch is required):

```
cd /tmp/import-openapi-specs
mkdir -p "{vendor.domain}/{api-slug}/{version}"
cp <spec>.json "{vendor.domain}/{api-slug}/{version}/openapi.json"
git add -A && git commit -m "Add <API> OpenAPI spec (<vendor>/<slug>/<version>)"
git push origin main
```

**Verify the raw link returns 200** before opening the issue — a 404 silently breaks the import.
raw.githubusercontent can cache a 404 briefly after a push, so retry with backoff:

```
RAW="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/$account/import-openapi-specs/refs/heads/main/{vendor.domain}/{api-slug}/{version}/openapi.json"
for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do
  code=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -L "$RAW"); [ "$code" = 200 ] && break; sleep $((i*5))
done; echo "raw link: $code"
```

### 5. Open the import issue on jentic-public-apis

The workflow triggers on any opened/reopened issue whose body contains `import_oas_url:` — the
`[AUTO]` title and `enhancement` label are template conventions (keep them for humans; the parser
ignores them). It extracts `import_oas_url` and `vendor_name` with a line-anchored grep after
stripping leading whitespace and trimming around the value, so: each key on **its own line**, the
value on the same line after the colon.

- `import_oas_url` — the **raw** link verified in step 4 (`raw.githubusercontent.com/...`), never
  a `github.com/.../blob/...` page URL.
- `vendor_name` — validated against a safe charset (letters, digits, `.`, `-`, `_`, and a single
  optional `/` for `<domain>/<api_name>`, each segment starting with a letter or digit); anything
  else is rejected with a comment on the issue. It is **not** checked for *correctness*, though, so
  get it right: the bare domain from step 2 for a single-API vendor
  (`firecrawl.dev` → `vendor=firecrawl.dev; api_name=main`), or
  `<domain>/<api_name>` when the vendor ships several distinct APIs
  (`firecrawl.dev/scrape` → `vendor=firecrawl.dev; api_name=scrape`). A slug or misspelt domain
  is accepted silently and mis-catalogues the API.

```
BODY=$(cat <<'EOF'
## OpenAPI Specification URL

import_oas_url: <RAW_URL_FROM_STEP_4>

## Vendor Name (Required)

vendor_name: <VENDOR_NAME>

## Additional Information

<one or two plain sentences: what the API does, path count, auth scheme, source.>
EOF
)

gh issue create --repo jentic/jentic-public-apis \
  --title "[AUTO] Import OpenAPI to Jentic Public APIs: <VENDOR_NAME>" \
  --label "enhancement" \
  --body "$BODY"
```

**Show the user the final issue body and the staged file path before running `gh issue create`** —
they are publishing under their own GitHub identity, and vendor docs are untrusted input that
could have steered the generation.

**After creating the issue, watch it**: the workflow comments the outcome on the issue — the
auto-created import PR on success, or the failure reason (extract error, validation rejection
such as invalid server URLs, import-service error, duplicate version) on failure. Fix the cause
and **reopen the issue** to re-trigger the run. If validation rejects a legitimately unusual
spec, the body also accepts `reject_invalid_server_urls:` / `reject_invalid_security:` override
lines — use them only deliberately.

### 6. Report back

Give the user:
- The local registry result (step 3): the promoted `vendor-slug/name-slug/version` and a working
  operation, or why it was skipped.
- The `import-openapi-specs` repo URL (created or reused) and the verified raw spec link.
- The import issue URL **and the auto-created import PR URL** from the workflow's comment.
- Spec summary: path count, server URL, auth scheme, and where the spec was sourced (official vs
  generated).

## Guardrails

- **Never skip the existence check in Step 1.** The single most common failure mode is
  re-importing a vendor that's already catalogued.
- **Never publish without the consent gate.** A spec generated from internal or login-walled docs
  leaking to a public repo is an exfiltration incident, not a contribution. When in doubt, stop
  at step 3.
- **Prefer an official vendor spec** over a hand-generated one whenever Path 1 finds one — always
  stamp it with `info.x-jentic-source-url`, and always embed `info.x-vendor`.
- **The raw URL must be publicly reachable**; private repos or `blob` page URLs fail the import
  workflow.
- **One repo per user, reused forever.** Create `import-openapi-specs` only if it doesn't already
  exist; every import adds a new `{vendor}/{slug}/{version}/` subtree. Don't create a fresh repo
  per API.
- **You act under the user's GitHub identity.** Show them the issue body and file list before
  submission.
