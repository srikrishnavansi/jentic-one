GENERATED FILE — DO NOT EDIT.

This endpoint + permission reference is generated from code by `make endpoints`
(tools/endpoint_tree.py). Editing it by hand will be overwritten and will fail
the drift-guard test.

How to update (humans & agents)
-------------------------------
- The permission of a route is read from its
  `get_current_identity(required_permissions=[...])` dependency. To make a route's
  permission appear here, add that argument upstream.
- For routes whose permission is enforced in the service layer, edit the curated
  map `PATH_PERMISSION_OVERRIDES` / `ACTOR_TYPE_OVERRIDES` in
  `src/jentic_one/shared/web/endpoint_permissions.py`.
- Then run `make endpoints` (regenerates this file + endpoints.json) and
  `make openapi` (regenerates the specs), and commit code + artifacts together.

Agents: treat `src/jentic_one/shared/web/endpoint_permissions.py` as the editable
source of truth, never this file.

# Endpoint & permission reference

> **Generated file — do not edit by hand.** Produced by `make endpoints` from code. To correct an entry, edit `src/jentic_one/shared/web/endpoint_permissions.py` and regenerate (see [docs/reference/README.md](README.md)).

Every API endpoint grouped by its **typical caller**, then by surface, annotated with the **permission(s)** it requires.

> The grouping and the _Typical caller_ column are an **advisory hint** at who usually calls a route, inferred from the permission family. They are **not** an enforced restriction: access is gated by the **permission**, not the actor kind, so any actor holding the required permission can call the endpoint.

_Total endpoints: **174**._
