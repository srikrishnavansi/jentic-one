# Releasing Jentic One

Operational runbook for cutting a release. The *why* (versioning policy, the
decisions behind this setup) lives in [`VERSIONING.md`](../../VERSIONING.md); this
is the *how*.

## Cutting a release

Releases are automated with [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please)
(config: [`release-please-config.json`](../../release-please-config.json)):

1. Merge feature/fix PRs to `main` as usual (Conventional Commits, squash-merge).
2. release-please keeps a standing **Release PR** titled `chore(main): release X.Y.Z`.
   Its diff bumps the version in lockstep across `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, and
   every Helm `Chart.yaml`, and updates `CHANGELOG.md`. You may edit the
   changelog directly in that PR (optional).
3. **Merging the Release PR is the release.** release-please then tags `vX.Y.Z`,
   creates the GitHub Release, and (because the tag is pushed with the release
   App token) triggers [`release.yml`](../../.github/workflows/release.yml):
   - **gate** — builds the app, runs every migration on a fresh ephemeral
     SQLite DB, asserts each DB reached an Alembic head, and checks `/health`
     serves the tag version. Nothing publishes if this fails.
   - **smoke** — the full Helm smoke matrix (combined / parts / broker / +obs)
     on a kind cluster, reusing `smoke-helm.yml`. Unlike the post-merge run on
     `main`, this one blocks: a release cannot ship while any deployment mode
     is red.
   - **publish-image** — builds the `app` container image and pushes it to GHCR
     as `ghcr.io/<owner>/jentic-one-app` (tagged `X.Y.Z` — the `v` is stripped
     — and the short SHA; `latest` moves only on stable releases). One image
     serves every surface via `JENTIC__APPS`; this is the image self-hosters
     pull — see
     [`docs/installation/docker.md`](../installation/docker.md).
   - **release** — GoReleaser builds the signed, checksummed `jenticctl` +
     `jentic` binaries (cosign keyless + syft SBOMs) and publishes the package
     channels: the Homebrew cask, a winget manifest PR against
     `microsoft/winget-pkgs`, and the scoop bucket manifest. The winget/scoop
     publishes are token-gated: with `WINGET_TOKEN` / `SCOOP_BUCKET_TOKEN`
     unset the entry is skipped (logged, never fails the release) — see the
     one-time setup below.

Releases continue the pre-1.0 `0.x` line — see `VERSIONING.md` for the
versioning policy.

### Forcing or recovering a release

For a **partially failed run** (e.g. `publish-image` succeeded but GoReleaser
failed, or cosign/Sigstore hiccuped after the image pushed), the first move is
**"Re-run failed jobs"** on that run in the Actions UI: it re-executes only the
red jobs, leaving the already-pushed image (and its signature) untouched.
Two states worth knowing by name:

- **Published-but-unsigned**: the image push succeeded but the sign/attest
  step failed. `:latest` has *not* moved (it only moves after signing), but
  the `X.Y.Z`/SHA tags are live unsigned. Re-run the failed jobs — signing
  targets the already-pushed digest, so it converges.
- **Full re-run**: re-running *all* jobs rebuilds the image and `docker push`
  **overwrites** the existing `X.Y.Z`/SHA tags with a **new digest** (builds
  aren't bit-reproducible; the old digest stays pullable but untagged). The
  digest echoed by the *first* run then no longer matches the tag — anyone
  who pinned it keeps the old (still-signed) image. Prefer "Re-run failed
  jobs" precisely to avoid this.

When the run can't be recovered in place (the workflow itself needs a fix),
force a fresh release instead. release-please only opens a Release PR when
there are user-facing commits since the last release (`ci`, `chore`, `test`
and other hidden types don't trigger a bump) — to force one anyway, land a
commit on `main` whose footer sets the version explicitly:

```
ci(release): force patch release to republish artifacts

Release-As: 0.38.3
```

release-please then opens a `chore(main): release 0.38.3` PR; merging it cuts the
tag and re-runs `release.yml` (now from the fixed workflow on `main`), producing
a complete set of signed binaries + the package channels (cask, winget, scoop). A failed release version
is superseded by the next one — every release rebuilds all artifacts from
scratch, so nothing is lost by skipping it.


## Upgrading to the first theme-5 release

Operator-facing changes shipped by the theme-5 (toolkit removal) release —
read this before rolling it out. Each active window below is also tracked in
the Deprecations table.

- **The migration run performs the toolkit → direct-binding cutover.** On
  this release the broker authorizes on direct agent↔credential bindings by
  default (`broker.direct_bindings_enabled: true`), so every toolkit-bound
  agent needs its direct bindings **before** the new version serves traffic.
  `python -m jentic_one.migrations.run` does that itself: once every database
  is at head it runs two one-shot upgrade steps and prints one
  `==> upgrade step <name>: <action>` line (plus a JSON summary) for each —
  1. `theme5_retire_toolkit_keys` migrates every resolvable `jntc_live_`
     key to a successor agent (see the next bullet);
  2. `theme5_flatten_toolkits` derives a direct binding, carrying the pair's
     rules, for every `(agent, credential)` pair reachable through a toolkit
     (the `flatten-toolkits` job below). It runs **once per install** and is
     recorded in the control DB's `upgrade_steps` table, so a later upgrade
     never re-creates a binding you have since removed. It is skipped when a
     verified flatten is already acknowledged.

  Nothing extra to run on Helm (the pre-upgrade migrate hook), `jenticctl
  update`, or a hand-run migration. **Only a failed flatten blocks the
  upgrade**: the runner exits `4` so the new version never starts without
  its bindings; fix the logged cause and re-run (it is idempotent and not
  recorded until it completes). A key-retirement problem never blocks — it
  prints a `==> WARNING` line naming the recovery command, and the control
  plane retries the job at every boot. To get past a step deliberately,
  `--skip-upgrade-step <name>` defers that one step to the next full
  migration run (`--skip-upgrade-steps` defers both); on Helm set
  `migrate.extraArgs`, e.g. `["--skip-upgrade-step",
  "theme5_flatten_toolkits"]` — and then run `flatten-toolkits` yourself
  before serving traffic. Read the summary: `created_default_deny` counts
  pairs bound with **no** allow rule (conflicting toolkit rules, or a
  rule-less pair) and is also printed as a warning — the rest of the
  `flatten-toolkits` report categories are counted under `findings`; run
  `jentic_one flatten-toolkits --diff-only --report report.jsonl` to get the
  full lines for review.
- **Toolkit changes during a rolling upgrade are not flattened.** Helm (and
  any rolling deploy) migrates while the previous version still serves: a
  toolkit, toolkit binding, or agent–toolkit binding created on the old
  version *after* the migration's flatten has no direct binding on the new
  one, and the migration never flattens a second time. Freeze toolkit edits
  for the rollout, or re-run `jentic_one flatten-toolkits` once the new
  version is live (idempotent: it only adds the missing pairs).
- **`jntc_live_` toolkit keys are retired; migration to an agent is
  automatic.** No new keys are issued. The migration run (and every
  control-plane boot) migrates every existing key digest to a successor
  agent (before theme 8 the job created a service account instead, which
  the theme-8 migration then moved onto an agent), and the **unchanged
  plaintext keeps authenticating** as that agent for the deprecation window.
  Keys with no resolvable owner are skipped and
  reported (a `==> WARNING` line on the migration run): **their holders stop
  authenticating** until you run `jentic_one retire-toolkit-keys --owner
  <admin-email>`. The job writes a `migrated_actor_id` stamp on each
  `toolkit_keys` row and creates the successor agents and their bindings; a
  0.39.x rollback ignores all three. Watch `deprecated_toolkit_key_used`
  WARNING logs to find holders still presenting the old key form, and rotate
  them to the successor agent's `jak_` key (`sak_` keys can no longer be
  issued).
- **Docker images run as uid `10001`** (was `999`), so kubelet can verify
  `runAsNonRoot`. Anything the container writes must be writable by that uid:
  `jenticctl` re-owns its SQLite data volume automatically on `update` and
  `start`; for a hand-run `docker run` with a SQLite volume, run
  `docker run --rm --user 0:0 --entrypoint chown -v <volume>:/data <image>
  -R 10001:10001 /data` once before starting the new version (the symptom
  otherwise is `attempt to write a readonly database`). Postgres installs are
  unaffected.
- **The toolkit management surface is gone.** All `/toolkits/*` and
  `/agents/{id}/toolkits*` routes now return `404`. The `toolkits:read`,
  `toolkits:write`, and `owner:toolkits:read` scopes are retired: no route
  requires them and they grant nothing, but they are **tolerated in stored
  grants** — re-submitting a permission row that predates
  the retirement never fails validation. Access is managed on the
  agent↔credential axis instead: the agent detail **Access** tab ("Bound
  credentials") in the UI, or `POST /agents/{agent_id}/credentials`.
- **CLI: `--toolkit` → `--api`.** At this release, `jentic access request
  --api <vendor/name>` was the verb (`--provision` when nothing served the
  API yet), with `--toolkit` surviving as a hidden, deprecated alias for
  `--api`. *(Superseded: the theme-7 release —
  [epic #1374](https://github.com/jentic/jentic-one/issues/1374) — removes
  the access-request flow and the `jentic access` group entirely; the
  agent-driven connect flow, `jentic connect <vendor>` over
  `POST /integrations:connect`, is the replacement.)*
- **Broker headers.** Requests are disambiguated with `Jentic-Credential-Name`
  or `Jentic-Credential-Id` (the id is authoritative); responses attribute the
  credential used via the same two headers. The `Jentic-Toolkit-Id` response
  header is emitted only on the legacy flag-off toolkit path
  (`broker.direct_bindings_enabled: false`) and is removed in Phase 6b —
  adopt the credential headers now.
- **Toolkit tables are still present.** The stored toolkit rows (bindings,
  keys) survive this release; they are dropped in Phase 6b. Before that
  release you must complete the Phase 6a verify/acknowledge runbook below
  — the Phase-6b drop migrations refuse to run until the acknowledgement is
  on record. The acknowledgement is never automatic.

### Phase 6a runbook: export, flatten, verify, acknowledge

Run these against **production data** (all commands read/write the live
control + admin databases configured for the process). Order matters. The
migration run already performed the flatten (step 3) once; the remaining
steps are what stands between you and Phase 6b.

1. **Export first**: `jentic_one export-toolkits --out toolkit-export.json`.
   The file captures all five legacy tables (`toolkits`, `toolkit_keys`,
   `toolkit_credential_bindings`, `toolkit_permission_rules`,
   `agent_toolkit_bindings`) with row counts and dialect-neutral values. It
   embeds key hash digests — store it like a secrets backup.
2. *(Optional)* preview: `jentic_one flatten-toolkits --diff-only --report
   preview.jsonl` writes the report without touching either database.
3. **Flatten** (already done once by the migration run — re-run it if
   toolkits changed on the old version during the rollout):
   `jentic_one flatten-toolkits --report flatten.jsonl`. Every
   `(agent, credential)` pair reachable through a toolkit gains a direct
   binding carrying the pair's rules. Read the report: `rule_conflict` lines
   are pairs whose toolkit paths disagreed — they were bound **default-deny**
   (the safer outcome) and need a rules decision from you;
   `inactive_toolkit_binding` lines are live access you may have believed
   disabled (an inactive toolkit never gated bound agents) — they were
   migrated, review them; `pooled_rule_drift` lines are pairs whose effective
   rules narrowed from vendor-pooled to per-pair; `active_toolkit_key` lines
   want `retire-toolkit-keys` (or a revoke) on 0.40.x — the command is gone
   in 0.41.0, whose `--verify` fails (and whose drop migration refuses to
   run) while any such key remains.
4. **Double-run-and-diff** (the concurrency check — binds racing step 3 are
   possible since OSS cannot quiesce the bind endpoints): run
   `jentic_one flatten-toolkits` again and confirm it reports **zero
   creations**. If it created rows, repeat until a run creates nothing.
5. **Verify**: `jentic_one flatten-toolkits --verify` — recomputes the legacy
   pair set and fails unless every pair exists as a direct binding (extra
   hand-created bindings are fine). Rule-list divergence is reported, not
   fatal.
6. **Acknowledge**: `jentic_one flatten-toolkits --verify --acknowledge` —
   records the sentinel row (`toolkit_flattening_acks`, control DB) that the
   Phase-6b drop migrations require. It is refused unless the verification
   passes in that same invocation.

**Rollback after Phase 6b** is two steps, not one — see the Phase 6b
section below.

## Upgrading to 0.41.0

0.41.0 is the theme-5 Phase 6b release: it drops the toolkit tables (details
in the next section). Two rules:

1. **Upgrade via 0.40.x first.** 0.40.x runs the toolkit-key retirement and
   the one-shot flatten that 0.41.0 no longer carries. Skipping straight from
   an older release leaves unmigrated `jntc_live_` keys (they stop
   authenticating) and a toolkit graph with no direct bindings.
2. **Run `jentic_one flatten-toolkits --verify --acknowledge` on 0.41 before
   the drops.** An acknowledgement written by 0.40 does not qualify. On the
   0.41 image: `jentic_one flatten-toolkits` (it backfills execution toolkit
   names), re-run until it creates nothing, then `jentic_one
   flatten-toolkits --verify --acknowledge`, then `python -m
   jentic_one.migrations.run`. Until then the drop migration refuses to run
   and names the missing step, leaving the toolkit tables untouched.

Take the Phase 6a export (`jentic_one export-toolkits --out <file>`) before
upgrading. A rollback of an upgrade that stopped before the service-account
drop needs it (see [Rollback (Phase 6b → 6a)](#rollback-phase-6b--6a)).

0.41.0 also carries theme-8 Phase 4, which drops the service-account tables
([below](#upgrading-to-the-theme-8-phase-4-release-service-account-tables-dropped)).
A third rule applies:

3. **Snapshot both the admin and the control databases before upgrading.**
   The service-account retirement is **automatic** — there is no command to
   run and nothing to acknowledge — but it is **irreversible**, and it
   writes to **both** databases: the service-account tables in admin are
   dropped, and the `sva_`-keyed inline permission rules in control are
   deleted. Once that has happened, the data comes back only from the
   snapshots. **Rollback** is: restore **both** the admin and the control
   databases from these snapshots, then roll the code back to 0.40.x (see
   [Rollback (Phase 6b → 6a)](#rollback-phase-6b--6a)); restoring admin
   alone is not a rollback. The migration
   runner (`python -m jentic_one.migrations.run`, the deployment Job) stops
   admin just before the drop, migrates every remaining service account to
   its successor agent, verifies the result, sweeps the service-account
   side, and only then drops the tables. If the verification fails it
   **refuses**: it exits `4`, names each service account and why, and
   **drops nothing** — see [If the retirement refuses](#if-the-retirement-refuses).
   An install that never had service accounts just drops the empty tables.
4. **Move `sak_` callers to `jak_` keys before upgrading.** **Breaking:**
   `sak_` service-account keys stop working in 0.41.0. Every request with
   one gets a `401` whose detail says the key was retired and names the
   replacement (a `jak_` key for the successor agent), and the refusal is
   logged at INFO (`retired_service_account_key_refused`, with the successor
   agent id). There is no grace period. For **zero downtime**, do it on
   0.40.x: the successor agents already exist there (0.40.x migrated every
   service account at boot), named `service-account:<sva_ id>`. For each
   one, mint a key (`POST /agents/{agent_id}:generate-api-key`, or the
   agent's **Keys** panel in the UI), switch the callers to it, and only
   then upgrade. 0.41.0 lists every service account and its successor agent
   in a WARNING summary when the retirement completes (see
   [the Phase-4 section](#upgrading-to-the-theme-8-phase-4-release-service-account-tables-dropped)).
   `jntc_live_` toolkit keys are **not** affected: a converted one keeps
   authenticating as its successor agent until at least 2026-12-01.

## Upgrading to the theme-5 Phase 6b release (the drops)

This is the release that deletes the toolkit data model. It refuses to
migrate until the Phase 6a runbook above has been completed and
acknowledged. Read this **before** running migrations.

- **Prerequisite: an acknowledgement written by *this* release.** The
  control-DB migration drops `toolkit_permission_rules`,
  `toolkit_credential_bindings`, `toolkit_keys`, and `toolkits` (children
  first). It is gated guard-and-raise: it proceeds only when either every
  one of those tables is empty (fresh installs, CI), or a qualifying
  `toolkit_flattening_acks` row exists. Qualifying means both:
  - **Written by this release's `flatten-toolkits --verify --acknowledge`.**
    An acknowledgement from 0.40 does **not** qualify: 0.40's verification
    never checked that historical execution records carry their toolkit
    name (see *Historical executions* below), and the drop would erase the
    names it missed. Existing rows are marked non-qualifying by control
    migration `f2b3c4d5e6a7`.
  - **Not stale.** The acknowledgement records a digest of the legacy toolkit
    rows it covered. Toolkit rows added or removed afterwards (e.g. edits
    served by a 0.40 replica during a rolling upgrade) refuse the drop.

  Independently of the acknowledgement, the drop also refuses while any
  `toolkit_keys` row is **live and unmigrated** (`revoked = false` and no
  `migrated_actor_id`): that key has no successor agent and would stop
  authenticating the moment the table drops. This release's
  `flatten-toolkits --verify` fails on the same condition (a
  `verify_live_toolkit_keys` report line), so `--acknowledge` is refused
  too. Remediation: upgrade via 0.40.x and run `retire-toolkit-keys` (no
  release ships a command or route that revokes a toolkit key; if the key
  must not get a successor, set `revoked = true` on its `toolkit_keys` row
  in SQL instead). 0.41 no longer ships `retire-toolkit-keys`; to use it after
  the drop has refused, downgrade control to `e1a2b3c4d5f6` on the 0.41
  image (`python -m jentic_one.migrations.run --db control --direction down
  --target e1a2b3c4d5f6`), run the command on 0.40.x, then upgrade again.

  On any other state it raises naming the reason (live unmigrated keys / no
  ack / earlier-release ack / stale ack), with the runbook steps, and leaves
  the toolkit tables untouched. The runner exits `1` with a Python traceback
  whose last line is that `RuntimeError` message (unlike the service-account
  refusal below, which exits `4` with a plain message). `migrations.run` has already applied `f2b3c4d5e6a7` by then, so
  on the new release's image: run `jentic_one flatten-toolkits` (it backfills
  the execution names), re-run until it creates nothing, run
  `jentic_one flatten-toolkits --verify --acknowledge`, and re-run
  `migrations.run`.
- **Enterprise deployments: apply the overlay migration first.** On
  PostgreSQL the drop also refuses to run while any table outside the
  toolkit set still holds a foreign key into `toolkits` (the enterprise
  `toolkit_user_grants` FK). Apply the jentic-one-enterprise migration that
  drops that table (`d47c3a91be02`) before this release's migrations; the
  error message names it.
- **Admin DB**: `agent_toolkit_bindings` is dropped behind an analogous gate.
  When the migration's connection can read the control schema's
  `toolkit_flattening_acks` (PostgreSQL, one database, a role with access to
  both schemas), it applies the same rule as the control drop: a qualifying
  acknowledgement whose digest covers the current bindings. Otherwise (the
  default per-surface roles, separate databases, or SQLite) it falls back to
  in-DB evidence that the flattening ran — at least one direct binding in
  `agent_credential_bindings` — and relies on the control drop, which
  `migrations.run` applies first, for the strict check. The retired `toolkits:read` /
  `toolkits:write` / `owner:toolkits:read` scope strings are also swept from
  every stored grant and token surface — they have granted nothing since
  Phase 5b, and after the sweep they no longer appear in `/me` or token
  introspection output.
- **Key retirement ends; migrated `jntc_live_` keys keep working until the
  published date.** The `jentic_one retire-toolkit-keys` command, the
  control-plane boot retirement task and the `theme5_retire_toolkit_keys` /
  `theme5_flatten_toolkits` post-migration steps are gone with the
  `toolkit_keys` table. `--skip-upgrade-step` still accepts those two names
  so an old Helm `migrate.extraArgs` keeps working, but they are ignored.
  A key that was **migrated** before this upgrade keeps authenticating as
  its successor agent (theme-8 Phase 1 moved every migrated service account
  onto one) — the plaintext is resolved by its digest, which needs no
  toolkit table — until the deprecation window in the table below closes
  (no earlier than **2026-12-01**). A live key **not** migrated (e.g. an
  ownerless key never handed `retire-toolkit-keys --owner`) would stop
  authenticating (`401`), so the drop refuses to run while one exists (see
  the prerequisite above): resolve every ownerless-key warning from the 0.40
  migration run — retire or revoke the key — before upgrading. Afterwards, rotate holders flagged by
  the `deprecated_toolkit_key_used` WARNING log to a `jak_` key minted for
  their successor agent. The service-account → agent migration no longer
  copies toolkit bindings or re-stamps `toolkit_keys` (both tables are gone);
  it still copies scope grants, credential bindings and their inline rules.
- **The `Jentic-Toolkit-Id` header is gone**, on both sides: it is no longer
  read on requests (it was already ignored on the default path) and no
  longer emitted on responses. A request that still sends it is served
  normally; the broker strips the header rather than forwarding it
  upstream, through the deprecation window (no earlier than 2026-12-01). Attribution rides `Jentic-Credential-Id` /
  `Jentic-Credential-Name`. The `tracestate` vendor value keeps its
  five-field shape; the second (toolkit) segment is now always `_`.
- **The `broker.direct_bindings_enabled` config key is deleted.** Direct
  agent↔credential bindings are the only authorization path. A leftover
  `true` (the 0.40 default) is ignored; a leftover `false` — in the config
  file or as `JENTIC__BROKER__DIRECT_BINDINGS_ENABLED` — **fails config
  validation at boot** with a message naming the key, because the toolkit
  path it selected no longer exists to fall back to. Remove it; deployments
  that had it `false` must complete Phase 6a first.
- **Historical executions keep their toolkit names.** Execution list/detail
  responses still show `toolkit_name` for pre-flattening records: the name
  is denormalized onto `execution_records` (backfilled by this release's
  `flatten-toolkits`, which is why an acknowledgement from 0.40 does not
  unblock the drop) instead of resolved from the dropped `toolkits` table.
  Records whose toolkit was deleted before the backfill show `null`, exactly
  as before. Monitoring `group_by=toolkit` keeps working off the surviving
  `toolkit_id` attribution column.

### Rollback (Phase 6b → 6a)

0.41.0 also carries the theme-8 Phase-4 service-account drop (admin
`e2f3a4b5c6d7`), which is **irreversible**: its downgrade refuses. Which
rollback applies depends on how far the upgrade got — check with `python -m
jentic_one.migrations.run --check` (the `STATUS admin` line):

- **Admin is past `e2f3a4b5c6d7`** (the upgrade completed): restore **both**
  the admin and the control databases from the snapshots taken before the
  upgrade, then roll the code back to 0.40.x. The snapshots already hold the
  0.40.x schema — toolkit tables and service accounts included — so there is
  nothing to downgrade or re-import. Changes written since the upgrade are
  lost. Do not restore admin alone: the retirement deleted the `sva_`-keyed
  inline permission rules from the control database, which 0.40.x still
  needs for any service account that was unmigrated at snapshot time.
- **Admin stopped at `d1e2f3a4b5c6` or below** (for example, the
  service-account retirement refused, so nothing was dropped on the
  service-account side): the on-image downgrade below still works.

The downgrade path runs **on the 0.41 image first**, then moves the code
back. The previous release (0.40.x) does not ship this release's revision
scripts (control `f2b3c4d5e6a7` / `f3c4d5e6a7b8`, admin `c0e1f2a3b4c5` /
`d1e2f3a4b5c6`), so its Alembic cannot downgrade them — nor even start
against a database stamped with them. Order:

1. **Downgrade, on the 0.41 image**, to the last revisions 0.40.x knows:
   `python -m jentic_one.migrations.run --db control --direction down
   --target e1a2b3c4d5f6` and `python -m jentic_one.migrations.run --db
   admin --direction down --target 3e7a91c4b2d8`. The drops' `downgrade()` recreates the five tables
   **empty** — it cannot restore rows. The admin downgrade also reverts
   `c0e1f2a3b4c5`, which drops `execution_records.toolkit_name` (the
   historical names 0.40 resolves from the restored `toolkits` table
   instead), and the control one reverts `f2b3c4d5e6a7`, dropping the
   acknowledgement evidence columns.
2. **Re-import, on the 0.41 image**: `jentic_one export-toolkits --import
   toolkit-export.json` with the file from Phase 6a step 1. Restoring the
   toolkit path with an empty `toolkit_permission_rules` is a **total
   default-deny authorization outage** for every agent on the legacy path —
   never skip the import. The import is additive and idempotent by primary
   key, so re-running it (or importing over rows created after the
   downgrade) is safe.
3. **Only then roll the code back** to 0.40.x.

The scope sweep is not reversed on rollback: the swept scopes granted
nothing.

## Upgrading to the first theme-8 release

Operator-facing changes shipped by the theme-8 (service-account removal)
Phase-1 release. Service accounts are migrated to successor **agents**; the
SA surface survives this release (Phase 2 removes it) but is stamp-guarded.

- **Migration is automatic and idempotent.** The combined/control server runs
  `migrate-service-accounts` once at startup (best-effort; the CLI is the
  recovery path). Every service account is copied to a successor agent —
  stored permission grants (empty stays empty; never the default agent
  permission set), toolkit/credential bindings, the per-binding inline permission
  rules (control DB), and the API-key digest — its outstanding opaque
  sessions are revoked, and the row is stamped (`migrated_to_actor_id`).
  **API-key callers keep authenticating**: the resolver is now agent-first,
  so migrated `sak_`/`jntc_live_` plaintexts keep working without a key
  change (`sak_` keys only until 0.41.0, which refuses them) — but they now authenticate **as the successor agent**, which
  changes behaviour on a few endpoints (next bullet). Non-active SAs
  (pending/rejected/archived) are skipped-but-stamped; disabled SAs get a
  disabled successor.
- **Breaking for migrated `sak_` callers** (they are agents now):
  `POST /oauth/mint` returns `403` (it requires a service-account actor);
  `POST /integrations:connect` rejects `agent_id` in the request body (an
  agent caller *is* the agent); and an agent-initiated connect session can
  no longer be confirmed by the same caller — agent-initiated sessions need
  a human on the review page. Move these flows to a user/owner identity
  before upgrading.
- **Ownership and visibility shift.** The successor is created with
  `parent_actor_id` = the SA's owner, so (a) it becomes visible to
  `owner:agents:read` holders, and (b) any copied `owner:*` delegation permission
  now widens to the **owner's** resources — review SAs holding `owner:*`
  grants in the report. (c) Control-DB objects `created_by` the `sva_` id
  (credentials and access requests, whose owner-scoped reads key on
  `created_by`) are **not** re-attributed, so the successor loses
  owner-scoped access to them; re-create or re-assign them if the caller
  needs them. The JSONL report's `owner_visibility_note` repeats this per
  migrated SA.
- **Broker JWTs may only assert `actor_type=agent`.** A trusted-issuer JWT
  claiming `service_account` is now refused (uniform 401; `jwt_refused`
  WARNING with `jwt_actor_type_not_allowed`) — the JWT path reads no DB and
  would bypass the migration entirely. Re-issue such tokens against the
  successor agent. **Breaking** for issuers minting SA claims.
- **Rotating a successor agent's API key ends the old plaintext.** The
  migrated `sak_`/`jntc_live_` plaintext authenticates via the copied
  digest (`sak_` until 0.41.0); rotating or revoking the successor's key replaces that digest —
  deliberate, audited, irreversible.

### Theme-8 Phase 1 runbook: snapshot, migrate, sweep, verify, acknowledge

> **0.40.x only.** 0.41.0 (theme-8 Phase 4) removed the
> `migrate-service-accounts` command, the boot job and the acknowledgement:
> the migration runner migrates, verifies and sweeps any remaining service
> account automatically before the drop
> ([below](#upgrading-to-the-theme-8-phase-4-release-service-account-tables-dropped)).
> The steps here describe the 0.40.x tooling; running them first on 0.40.x
> is optional.

Run against **production data**; order matters.

1. **Snapshot first**: take admin-DB and control-DB snapshots before the
   first production run. Pre-sweep reversal is stamp-based and lossless
   (delete successor agents + their credential/grant/binding rows and their
   control-DB inline permission rules by stamp, clear the stamps — the SA
   originals are still live); **post-sweep reversal requires the
   snapshots**. Token revocation is acceptable-irreversible in both stages.
2. *(Optional)* preview: `jentic_one migrate-service-accounts --diff-only
   --report preview.jsonl` — evaluates dispositions without writing. Review
   the JSONL: `had_client_secret` names every client-credentials holder
   (that grant channel dies in Phase 2), and the owner-visibility notes tell
   you which successors become visible to `owner:agents:read` holders.
3. **Migrate**: `jentic_one migrate-service-accounts --report run.jsonl`
   (or let the boot job do it). Re-runs are cheap no-ops via the stamp and
   pick up SAs created during the window.
4. **Dual-kill note (the window)**: disabling a migrated SA is refused
   (`409 service_account_migrated`) and would not cut its key anyway — new
   pods resolve agent-first and never consult SA status. **To cut a key,
   disable the successor agent** (the stamp gives the `sva_ → agnt_`
   mapping) or revoke its API key; new pods then **fail closed** — a
   disabled successor (or a stamped SA whose successor digest is gone)
   never falls back to the SA row (`migrated_key_fail_closed` WARNING).
   Old-image pods still honour the SA status until the fleet rollout
   completes. **Client-credentials holders** are not cut by either lever —
   a pre-sweep `client_credentials` login still mints an SA session (step
   7); the kill lever for them is the sweep: `jentic_one
   migrate-service-accounts --sweep-migrated` archives the SA (the grant
   then refuses it) and revokes every SA session it minted since the
   migration, in one transaction.
5. **Watch the fallback signal**: every key still resolving through the SA
   fallback logs a `service_account_fallback_resolve` WARNING and bumps the
   `auth_service_account_fallback_resolves` OTel counter
   (`auth_service_account_fallback_resolves_total` on the Prometheus
   exporter; needs `metrics.exporter` configured — it is an operator
   metric, not a phone-home telemetry event). Trending to zero is the sweep-readiness signal;
   sustained hits after the fleet rollout mean unmigrated stragglers —
   re-run the job.
6. **Sweep**: the boot job's automatic sweep archives migrated SAs (deleting
   the SA-keyed grant/binding rows and the `sva_`-keyed inline permission
   rules, NULLing the SA-side digest, and revoking any SA sessions minted
   since the migration) only once
   a stamp is older than
   `services.service_account_sweep_min_stamp_age_hours` (default 24 — the
   full-fleet-rollout proxy; `0` disables the gate, a negative value
   disables the automatic sweep entirely). Run `jentic_one
   migrate-service-accounts --sweep-migrated` to sweep immediately — only
   when no old-image pods remain (their SA arm needs the SA-keyed rows).
7. **Window semantics, stated**: outstanding SA tokens die at migration;
   API-key callers keep authenticating as the successor agent (per-request
   digest re-resolve) with the agent-caller behaviour changes listed above;
   a pre-sweep client-credentials login still mints a fully-scoped SA
   session (bounded to pre-existing `client_secret_hash` holders — the
   step-2 report names them; new client secrets cannot be registered, the
   endpoint is unrouted) until the sweep revokes those sessions and
   archives the SA (step 4).
8. **Verify**: `jentic_one migrate-service-accounts --verify` — zero
   unstamped rows, grant-twin parity, zero unrevoked live SA tokens, digest
   parity, no post-stamp mutation, and inline-rule parity (every `sva_`
   binding still holding control-DB rules has a successor twin with the same
   rule count; swept rows pass). Live SA sessions minted by
   client-credentials holders fail criterion 3 until the sweep revokes them.
9. **Acknowledge**: `jentic_one migrate-service-accounts --verify
   --acknowledge` — records the sentinel row
   (`service_account_migration_acks`, admin DB) that the theme-8 Phase-4
   drop migrations require. Refused unless the verification passes in that
   same invocation.

## Upgrading to the theme-8 Phase-2 release (service-account surface removed)

**Breaking.** The service-account management and token surface is deleted;
run the Phase-1 migration (above) first — the boot job still does it.

- **Routes removed:** every `/service-accounts…` route (create, list, get,
  approve/deny/disable/enable/archive, scopes, `:generate-api-key`) and
  `POST /oauth/mint` now return `404`. The gateway
  chart no longer routes `/service-accounts`.
- **`client_credentials` grant removed:** `POST /oauth/token` with
  `grant_type=client_credentials` returns `400 unsupported_grant_type`, and
  `client_credentials` is gone from `grant_types_supported` in the
  authorization-server metadata. Move holders to the successor agent's
  `jak_` API key (or the jwt-bearer grant).
- **SA sessions are dead:** an outstanding `service_account` access or
  refresh token introspects inactive, cannot be refreshed, and is refused at
  the broker.
- **API keys keep working:** migrated `sak_`/`jntc_live_` plaintexts keep
  authenticating as the successor agent; an unmigrated `sak_` key still
  resolves through the SA fallback (and `GET /me` / MCP `me` still answer
  for it) until Phase 4. Phase 4 (0.41.0) refuses every `sak_` key.
- **Scopes retired:** `service-accounts:read`, `service-accounts:write` and
  `owner:service-accounts:read` are no longer granted, listed, or implied by
  `org:admin`; stored grants of them are tolerated (a re-submitted scope
  set containing them is not a 422) and simply grant nothing.
- **Actor directory:** `GET /actors` lists users and agents only.
- **CLI:** the generated control client drops the service-account
  operations, and `jentic api endpoints --actor service_account` no longer
  matches any endpoint (agents are the only machine actor — filter with
  `--actor agent`).

## Upgrading to the theme-8 Phase-4 release (service-account tables dropped)

**Breaking.** This release (0.41.0) drops the `service_accounts`,
`service_account_credentials` and `service_account_migration_acks` tables
(admin migration `e2f3a4b5c6d7`) and removes the last service-account code
paths. Read this **before** running migrations.

- **Snapshot both databases first.** Take admin-DB **and** control-DB
  snapshots before upgrading. The drop is irreversible (its downgrade
  refuses) and the retirement writes to both databases, so restoring both
  snapshots, then rolling the code back, is the only way back (see
  *Rollback* below).
- **The retirement is automatic.** On a full upgrade (`python -m
  jentic_one.migrations.run` with no `--db` or `--target`), the runner
  migrates control, brings admin to `d1e2f3a4b5c6` (just before the drop),
  and then, under a lock:
  1. **Migrates** every service account not yet migrated, exactly as the
     0.40 job did: the permission grants, credential bindings, control-DB inline
     permission rules and API-key digest are copied to a successor agent
     named `service-account:<sva_ id>`, and outstanding SA sessions are
     revoked. Non-active service accounts are stamped without a successor.
     The inline rules are copied only onto bindings the retirement creates
     in this run. For a service account migrated earlier (by 0.40), grants
     and bindings added to it **after** its migration are copied to the
     successor too (a binding with its inline rules), unless the successor
     is archived or gone, or the audit log shows the successor had that
     permission removed or that binding purged. Nothing is ever copied onto an
     existing successor grant, binding or rule list: anything an operator
     removed from the successor since — including a binding whose inline
     rules were emptied — is **not** restored.
  2. **Verifies** before touching anything: no failed migration, nothing
     left unmigrated, every grant and binding present on the successor
     (except the withheld ones above), and, for the service accounts
     migrated in this run, the same inline rules per binding in the control
     DB. The key digest is not
     checked: `sak_` keys stop working in this release whatever the
     successor holds (the copied digest only matters for a `jntc_live_`
     toolkit key that 0.40 converted into a service account).
  3. **Sweeps** the service-account side (grants, bindings, key digests,
     sessions, `sva_`-keyed inline rules — including rules left by service
     accounts that no longer exist), then applies the drop, which also
     cleans up `sva_`-keyed rows no service account owns and SA-typed token
     rows.

  It logs one `service_account_migration` line per service account and a
  `service_account_retirement_done` summary. When the retirement found
  service accounts, it then prints a WARNING summary to stdout and logs a
  `service_account_keys_retired` WARNING: each service account id and its
  successor agent id (ids only, never a key), and that `sak_` keys no longer
  authenticate — callers must switch to a `jak_` key for the listed agent.
  Every grant, binding or inline rule list the retirement deliberately did
  **not** copy (see step 1 — including an earlier successor binding that
  holds no inline rules while its service account's binding did) is printed
  as a `==> WARNING (service-account retirement, not copied)` line and
  logged as a `service_account_retirement_not_copied` WARNING, naming the
  service account, the successor agent and what was not copied. The
  retirement proceeds; review each line and re-grant on the successor agent
  whatever it still needs — the service-account originals are swept.
  A second run finds nothing to do. There is no command to run, no acknowledgement, and no configuration.
  If the verification fails, see
  [If the retirement refuses](#if-the-retirement-refuses).
- **Targeted or partial upgrades skip the retirement.** `scripts/migrate.sh`
  with no options runs the full runner. With `--db` (admin
  only, or admin before control) or `--target` (on the runner or
  `scripts/migrate.sh`), the runner does not retire,
  and the drop migration's own gate refuses to run while any service account
  is unmigrated or not yet swept. It names the ids and points at the full
  runner; nothing is dropped. A fresh install (empty tables) passes.
- **Rolling upgrades.** Once the tables are dropped, 0.40.x replicas still
  serving traffic cannot read them: a `sak_` or `jntc_live_` request to a
  0.40.x replica returns `500`, and a 0.40.x replica that restarts logs
  `service_account_migration_startup_failed` (the boot job fails; the
  server still starts). There is no 0.40.x patch for this: finish the
  rollout promptly, or drain 0.40.x replicas before the migration Job runs.
- **Retired permission strings are swept.** `service-accounts:read`,
  `service-accounts:write` and `owner:service-accounts:read` are removed from
  every stored grant and token surface, in the same way as the theme-5
  toolkit-permission sweep. They have granted nothing since Phase 2.
- **`sak_` keys stop working (breaking).** Every `sak_` key is refused,
  migrated or not, before any lookup: `401` with the detail *"Service-account
  keys (sak_) were retired in Jentic One 0.41: each service account was
  migrated to an agent. Mint a jak_ key for that agent and use it instead."*
  (admin, auth and broker surfaces; MCP answers with its usual `401`
  challenge). Each refusal logs `retired_service_account_key_refused` at
  INFO with the successor agent id when that agent still holds the retired
  key's digest (after you mint a new `jak_` key for it, as rule 4 advises,
  the id is logged as `null`). Move callers to a
  `jak_` key for the successor agent — ideally on 0.40.x before upgrading
  (see [Upgrading to 0.41.0](#upgrading-to-0410), rule 4).
- **Converted `jntc_live_` keys keep working** until at least 2026-12-01:
  they authenticate **as their successor agent**, and each resolve logs a
  `deprecated_toolkit_key_used` WARNING. Rotate holders to the agent's
  `jak_` key. A key that matches no agent is refused (`401`,
  `retired_key_unresolved` INFO), and so is one whose successor is disabled
  or whose digest was rotated away (`migrated_key_fail_closed`).
- **Leftover service-account rows fail closed.** Revoked or expired SA token
  rows are kept, and every token path refuses them: `/me`, introspection,
  refresh, revocation and the broker. Historical `sva_` ids in audit, event,
  execution and control-DB rows are labelled "retired service account" and
  are never resolved; a catalog auto-import initiated by one is skipped.
- **Removed:**
  - the `jentic_one migrate-service-accounts` command (all of `--diff-only`,
    `--sweep-migrated`, `--verify` and `--acknowledge`) and the
    control-plane boot migration job;
  - the `service_account_migration_acks` table — no acknowledgement is
    needed any more;
  - the `services.service_account_sweep_min_stamp_age_hours` config key.
    It is ignored with a single `config_retired_setting_ignored` WARNING;
    remove it (and `JENTIC__SERVICES__SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SWEEP_MIN_STAMP_AGE_HOURS`)
    from your config;
  - the `service_account_fallback_resolve` WARNING and the
    `auth_service_account_fallback_resolves` OTel counter;
  - the `service_account` value of `ActorType` in the API (`MeServiceAccount`
    is gone from `GET /me`);
  - the CLI's `service-account` mode alias. `--mode service-account`,
    `JENTIC_MODE=service-account` and a persisted `mode: service-account`
    are now an unknown mode, fenced like any other; use `agent`.

### If the retirement refuses

The runner exits `4` and prints `Refusing to retire the service accounts …`,
listing each service account id with the reason (for example, its migration
failed because its key digest already belongs to another agent, or the
successor lacks a grant). A
`service_account_retirement_refused` ERROR log carries the same ids.
**Nothing was swept or dropped**: admin stays at `d1e2f3a4b5c6` and every
service-account row is intact. Fix the named rows — typically restore the
missing grant or binding on the successor agent, or clear the conflicting
credential — then re-run the migration. Re-running is always safe.

### Rollback (theme-8 Phase 4)

The drop is **irreversible**. `e2f3a4b5c6d7` has no working downgrade:
`python -m jentic_one.migrations.run --direction down` (or any target below
it) refuses with `e2f3a4b5c6d7 is irreversible: the service-account data was
migrated to agents and dropped; restore the admin database from the
pre-upgrade snapshot …` and changes nothing. Empty service-account tables
would restore nothing, so none are recreated.

To go back, restore the admin **and** control databases from the snapshots
taken before the upgrade (control too, for the swept `sva_` inline rules),
then roll the code back — see [Rollback (Phase 6b → 6a)](#rollback-phase-6b--6a),
which covers both 0.41.0 drops. Changes written since the upgrade are lost.
Do not `alembic stamp` past the drop to force a downgrade: the schema would
claim tables that are not there.

## Reviewing grants and bindings carried over by the upgrade

The theme-5 and theme-8 upgrade steps preserve access exactly: nothing is
stripped. Two kinds of carried-over access are worth a deliberate review
after the upgrade:

- **Admin-level scopes on successor agents.** A migrated service account's
  grants are copied verbatim onto its `service-account:<sva_ id>` successor
  agent, including admin-level scopes (`org:admin`, `users:write`,
  `agents:write`, `credentials:write`, `config:write`,
  `oauth-clients:write`).
- **Cross-owner credential bindings.** A binding created by flattening or
  key retirement where the credential's creator is neither the agent's owner
  nor the agent itself (or where either side is unrecorded).

Where the upgrade reports them (all informational — none fails a step,
the service-account retirement, `--verify`, or `--acknowledge`; no secret
material is logged):

| Source | What it emits |
| ------ | ------------- |
| Service-account retirement (0.41 migration runner; the 0.40.x boot job or `migrate-service-accounts`) | `copied_scopes` and `admin_level_scopes` per SA on the `service_account_migration` log line (0.40.x: also in the `--report` JSONL), one `service_account_migration_admin_scope_copied` WARNING per admin-level grant, and the copied scope names in the migration's grant audit row. |
| `migrate-service-accounts --verify` (0.40.x only) | One `successor_admin_scope` report line per admin-level grant still held from the migration, `successor_admin_scope_count` in the summary, and a `==> REVIEW` line. After the drop, use the query below. |
| Toolkit flattening (upgrade step or `flatten-toolkits`) | `cross_owner_binding` findings in the report (run and `--verify`), a `toolkit_flattening_cross_owner_binding` WARNING per binding, and an `==> WARNING` line from the upgrade step. |
| Toolkit key retirement (upgrade step or boot) | `cross_owner_credential_ids` in the step outcome, a `toolkit_key_retirement_cross_owner_binding` WARNING per binding, and an `==> WARNING` line from the upgrade step. |

The same state can be listed at any time with read-only queries.

**Successor agents holding admin-level grants** (admin DB; on Postgres
run it with the admin connection's `schema_name` — `admin` in the shipped
configs — on the `search_path`, or prefix the tables with it):

```sql
SELECT a.id, a.name, a.owner_id, a.status, g.permission, g.granted_by
FROM actor_permission_grants g
JOIN agents a ON a.id = g.actor_id
WHERE g.actor_type = 'agent'
  AND a.name LIKE 'service-account:%'
  AND g.permission IN ('org:admin', 'users:write', 'agents:write',
                  'credentials:write', 'config:write', 'oauth-clients:write')
ORDER BY a.id, g.permission;
```

`granted_by = 'system:theme8-sa-migration'` marks a grant the migration
copied; any other grantor means someone has granted it since.

**Bindings whose credential creator differs from the agent owner.** The
bindings live in the admin DB and the credential creators in the control
DB, so on SQLite (one file per surface) this is two queries. On Postgres,
when the admin and control connections share one database (the shipped
configs, schemas `admin` and `control` — substitute your `schema_name`
values), it is one join; if they point at separate databases, use the
two-query form.

```sql
-- Postgres, shared database: one query across the admin and control schemas
SELECT b.agent_id, a.name, a.owner_id, b.credential_id, c.created_by
FROM admin.agent_credential_bindings b
JOIN admin.agents a ON a.id = b.agent_id
LEFT JOIN control.credentials c ON c.id = b.credential_id
WHERE c.created_by IS NULL
   OR a.owner_id IS NULL
   OR c.created_by NOT IN (a.owner_id, a.id)
ORDER BY b.agent_id, b.credential_id;
```

```sql
-- step 1 (admin DB): every binding with its agent's owner
SELECT b.agent_id, a.name, a.owner_id, b.credential_id
FROM agent_credential_bindings b
JOIN agents a ON a.id = b.agent_id
ORDER BY b.agent_id;

-- step 2 (control DB): the creators of those credentials
SELECT id, created_by FROM credentials WHERE id IN ('cred_…', …);
```

Flag a step-1 row when its credential's `created_by` (step 2) is missing or
is neither the row's `owner_id` nor its `agent_id`.

**What to do.** Expected rows need no action — the upgrade kept the access
the old model already allowed. For an unexpected one:

- narrow the agent's permissions with `PUT /agents/{agent_id}/permissions` (the
  body is the full permission set to keep), or disable the agent while you decide;
- remove a binding with
  `DELETE /agents/{agent_id}/credentials/{credential_id}`.

Both are ordinary, audited mutations.

## Upgrading to the permissions-rename release

Internal authorization is spelled "permission" on every surface (OAuth2/OIDC
names — `scope`, `allowed_scopes`, `scopes_supported`, `insufficient_scope` —
are unchanged). There are no compatibility aliases; read this before rolling
it out.

- **Schema.** The admin migration `e3f4a5b6c7d8` renames the table
  `actor_scope_grants` → `actor_permission_grants` and its column `scope` →
  `permission` (plus the unique constraint, primary key, and indexes). Stored
  values are unchanged (`agents:write` stays `agents:write`), and so are the
  `asg_…` row ids.
- **Expect an authentication gap during a rolling upgrade.** The previous
  release reads `actor_scope_grants` directly when it resolves API keys and
  opaque tokens for agents (and for unmigrated service-account keys). Once the
  migration has run, pods still on the previous release fail those lookups
  until they are replaced. The [upgrade contract](../operations/upgrades.md#the-contract)
  already treats old code on a new schema as unsupported — here it is an
  observable outage, so schedule the upgrade in a maintenance window, or scale
  the app and broker to zero before the migration and back up after it. With
  Helm, the migration runs as a `pre-upgrade` hook, so the window lasts from
  the hook until the rollout completes.
- **HTTP API.** `GET|PUT /agents/{id}/scopes` is now
  `/agents/{id}/permissions`, with `{"permissions": […]}` bodies; `GET /me`
  (including the service-account variant) reports `permissions` /
  `token_permissions` instead of `scopes` / `token_scopes`. The endpoint
  reference emits `required_permissions` under schema
  `jentic.endpoint-permission-tree/v1`. Audit rows keep their `scopes` payload
  key and `reason` strings.
- **CLI and Go SDK.** `jentic endpoints --scope` is now `--permission`.
  The generated control client renames `AgentScopesRequest`/`Response` to
  `AgentPermissionsRequest`/`Response`, and `MeAgent` exposes
  `Permissions`/`TokenPermissions` — a breaking change for Go importers of
  `github.com/jentic/jentic-one/cli`. Upgrade the CLI with the
  server: a mismatched CLI refuses `/me` and the endpoint reference with an
  error naming the version skew, rather than reporting an empty permission
  set.

## Deprecations

Active deprecation windows are registered here (the named channel) and
repeated in the GitHub Release notes of the release that opens each window.
An entry names what is deprecated, the release that opened the window, the
runtime signal an operator can watch, and the earliest removal point.

| Deprecated | Since | Runtime signal | Removal |
| ---------- | ----- | -------------- | ------- |
| `jntc_live_` toolkit API keys (theme-5 Phase 4). No new keys are issued. Keys migrated before the Phase 6b drops keep authenticating — as their successor **agents** once theme-8 Phase 1 migrates them; the `retire-toolkit-keys` command and the boot/migration retirement steps are gone with the `toolkit_keys` table (Phase 6b), so a key not migrated by then stops authenticating. Rotate holders to the successor agent's `jak_` key. | The first release carrying theme-5 Phase 4 (opened 2026-09-11). | `deprecated_toolkit_key_used` WARNING log lines — one per resolve, naming the successor agent presenting the retired key form. | Plaintext acceptance ends no earlier than **2026-12-01** (a follow-up to Phase 6b). |
| Service accounts (theme-8 Phase 1). Every SA is auto-migrated to a successor agent; the migrated `sak_`/`jntc_live_` plaintext keeps authenticating — as that agent (`sak_` until 0.41.0). The SA management surface, `POST /oauth/mint` and the `client_credentials` grant were removed in theme-8 Phase 2, and broker JWTs may no longer assert `actor_type=service_account`. Rotate holders to the successor agent's `jak_` key. | The first release carrying theme-8 Phase 1. | Until Phase 4: `service_account_fallback_resolve` WARNING log lines and the `auth_service_account_fallback_resolves` OTel counter (both removed with the fallback). | **Removed.** The surface went in theme-8 Phase 2; Phase 4 (0.41.0) retires any remaining service account automatically and drops the tables. |
| `sak_` service-account API keys (theme-8 Phase 4). No new keys could be issued; a key migrated to a successor agent authenticated as that agent through 0.40.x. Move holders to a `jak_` key for the successor agent (on 0.40.x, before upgrading, for zero downtime). | The first release carrying theme-8 Phase 1. | From 0.41.0: `retired_service_account_key_refused` INFO per refused request, and the upgrade's `service_account_keys_retired` WARNING summary. | **Removed in 0.41.0.** Every `sak_` key is refused with `401`; the detail names the retirement and the `jak_` replacement. Converted `jntc_live_` keys are unaffected (their own row). |


## One-time setup (repo/org admin)

The automation is inert until these are provisioned:

- **A scoped GitHub App** for the release trigger (a tag/release made with the
  default `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not trigger downstream workflows). Install it on
  this repo with repository permissions **Contents: RW, Issues: RW, Pull
  requests: RW** (Issues is required — release-please creates its `autorelease:*`
  labels via the Issues API). Add secrets `RELEASE_PLEASE_APP_ID` and
  `RELEASE_PLEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`.
- **`HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN`** — a fine-grained token with `contents: write` on
  `jentic/homebrew-tap` only (for the cross-repo cask push).
- **`SCOOP_BUCKET_TOKEN`** — same shape: a fine-grained token with
  `contents: write` on `jentic/scoop-bucket` only. Create that repo (public,
  empty is fine — GoReleaser commits `jentic.json` to its root on each
  release) before setting the secret.
- **`WINGET_TOKEN`** — a **classic** PAT with `public_repo` scope
  (fine-grained tokens cannot open cross-repo PRs against
  `microsoft/winget-pkgs`). Fork `microsoft/winget-pkgs` into the `jentic`
  org first; each release then pushes a manifest branch to the fork and opens
  the upstream PR. **Keep the fork's `master` synced** (GitHub's "Sync fork"
  button, or a scheduled sync) — a stale fork makes the generated PR conflict
  at tag time. The **first** submission goes through Microsoft's human
  review (typically days); later versions are auto-validated by bots. Until
  the first manifest lands, `winget install Jentic.Jentic` resolves nothing —
  the scoop bucket is the immediate Windows channel in the meantime.

Both Windows-channel secrets are **optional**: while unset, GoReleaser skips
that publisher with a log line and the release stays green (the
`skip_upload` templates in [`cli/.goreleaser.yaml`](../../cli/.goreleaser.yaml)). Provisioning the secret
is what turns the channel on.

cosign signing needs no secret — it uses the release job's OIDC token (keyless,
via Sigstore/Fulcio).

The **`publish-image`** stage needs no extra secret either — it pushes to GHCR
with the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` (the job grants it `packages: write`).

**First-release checklist:** the first push creates the `jentic-one-app`
package under the repo owner **as private**. After the first release, a
maintainer must set its visibility to **public** in the package settings —
until then self-hosters cannot `docker pull` without authenticating. GHCR's
**immutable tags** option is a trade-off, not a default: it hardens tags
against re-pushes, but breaks the full-re-run recovery path above (a full
re-run cannot overwrite `X.Y.Z`) — enable it only if you accept recovering
via "Re-run failed jobs" or `Release-As` instead. The image is cosign-signed
with an SBOM attestation; the verify commands live in [`deploy/README.md`](../../deploy/README.md)
("Verify the signature").

Also consider a **repository ruleset restricting `v*` tag creation** to the
release App and admins: the workflow trusts any pushed tag, and while the
gate's version assertion bounds what a rogue tag can ship, a signed release
should only ever be release-please-initiated.

## Verifying a release (supply chain)

GoReleaser signs `checksums.txt` with cosign keyless. To verify a downloaded
release:

```bash
# 1. verify the checksum file's cosign signature (keyless / Sigstore).
cosign verify-blob \
  --certificate checksums.txt.pem \
  --signature   checksums.txt.sig \
  --certificate-identity-regexp '^https://github\.com/jentic/jentic-one/\.github/workflows/release\.yml@refs/tags/v.*$' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer 'https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com' \
  checksums.txt

# 2. verify the artifact against the (now-trusted) checksum file.
sha256sum --check --ignore-missing checksums.txt
```

The **certificate identity** is the workflow that produced the signature:
`https://github.com/jentic/jentic-one/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/tags/vX.Y.Z`,
issued by GitHub Actions OIDC (`https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`).
Always pin both `--certificate-identity(-regexp)` and `--certificate-oidc-issuer`
— verifying without them accepts any Sigstore certificate and defeats the point.

Each archive also ships a syft SBOM (`*.sbom.json`) listing its contents.

> Note: the `brew install` path relies on the SHA-256 that Homebrew embeds in
> the cask (tamper-evident). The cosign signature above is for the direct-download
> / CI verification path.
