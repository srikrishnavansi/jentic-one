/**
 * Broker authorization (real backend).
 *
 * The broker's /execute path requires the caller's token to carry
 * `capabilities:execute` (BROKER_EXECUTE_SCOPE). The AUTHORIZATION SOURCE OF
 * TRUTH is the agent's scope grants (actor_permission_grants), read at token-mint
 * time. That source is fully testable here via the public scope API (the
 * endpoints that landed with #517): an agent granted the scope has it; an agent
 * not granted it does not. These are the assertions that decide whether a
 * broker call would be authorised.
 *
 * The actual broker round-trip (200 for granted, 403 insufficient_scope for
 * ungranted) is `test.fixme` — the broker is a separate process, not a callable
 * surface in the combined `make start-app` harness, and is further blocked by
 * #526 (resolver boot). Enable the round-trip assertions when the broker is
 * reachable in CI.
