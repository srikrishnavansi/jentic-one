/**
 * Full platform loop (real backend).
 *
 * The end-to-end "agent gets to actually call an upstream" journey is:
 *
 *   import API → create credential → bind credential to agent
 *     → grant capabilities:execute
 *     → mint agent token → broker GET → read execution back
 *
 * The PREFIX of that journey (everything up to and including the permission grant)
 * runs against the combined `make start-app` boot and is asserted here for
 * real. The BROKER TAIL (token → /execute → executions) cannot run in this
 * suite and is captured as `test.fixme` with the issues that block it:
 *
 *   - The combined app boot does not serve the broker surface as a callable
 *     /execute endpoint in this harness; the broker runs as its own process.
 *   - #526 (F-9): a standalone broker never installs the registry resolver, so
 *     every /execute 500s until that boot-ordering bug is fixed.
 *   - #527 (F-10): a vendor-only credential persists api_name='' (not NULL), so
 *     the broker's IS NULL wildcard never matches → no matching binding. The
 *     credential here pins the exact API identity to sidestep it, but the fix
 *     belongs upstream.
 *   - #539 (F-11): a successful broker execution did not surface in
 *     admin.execution_records / GET /executions (needs single-DB verification).
 *
 * When #526/#527/#539 land, the fixme tail can be un-fixme'd and asserted live.
