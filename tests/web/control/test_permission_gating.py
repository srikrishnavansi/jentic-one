"""Enforcement tests for least-privilege gating on control-plane read routes.

These lock in the route-guard behaviour introduced in the web-route permission
pass — both directions:

* An *under-scoped* caller (holds a real but unrelated scope) is **denied** 403
  on the newly gated reads, proving the gate is not a no-op.
* A *delegated agent* (minted ``owner:credentials:read`` via
  ``DEFAULT_AGENT_PERMISSIONS``, never the bare ``credentials:read``) is **admitted**
  past the guard so the service-layer delegation filter
  (``control/scoping/filters.py``) can scope its owner's rows. Without the
  OR-listed owner scope on the guard the agent would be 403'd before that
  filter ever ran.

The toolkit routes this suite once gated were deleted in theme-5 Phase 5b;
only the credential axis remains.
