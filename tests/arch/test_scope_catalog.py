"""Unit + drift tests for the conceptual scope catalogue.

The catalogue (``GET /reference/endpoints.json`` ``scopes`` section, and the
committed ``docs/reference/endpoints.json``) is built from
``ALL_PERMISSIONS`` so it can never diverge from the enforced permission set.
These tests pin that invariant and the derived shape the docs SPA relies on.
