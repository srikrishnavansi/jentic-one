"""Unit tests for control-surface dynamic query scoping.

Theme-5 Phase 5b collapsed the filter builder to the credential/direct axis
(the toolkit models themselves were deleted with the tables in Phase 6b).
Visibility widening for agents
now comes exclusively from ``bound_credential_ids`` — the caller-resolved
direct ``agent_credential_bindings`` ids. Theme 7 then removed the
``AccessRequest`` axis with the access-request feature. ``Credential`` and
``ConnectSession`` (initiator axis, reusing the credential delegation scope)
are the scoped models.
