"""Integration tests for retired ``jntc_live_`` / ``sak_`` key authentication.

The theme-5 and theme-8 migrations copied each retired key's SHA-256 digest
onto its successor agent (``agent_credentials.api_key_hash``). A
``jntc_live_`` plaintext keeps resolving as that *agent* until the published
deprecation date (no earlier than 2026-12-01); a digest no agent holds, or an
inactive successor, fails closed. ``sak_`` keys stopped working in 0.41
(theme-8 Phase 4): they are refused even when a successor holds the digest.
